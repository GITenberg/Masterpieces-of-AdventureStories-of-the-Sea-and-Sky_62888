EDITOR'S NOTE
</p>

<p>
In these volumes the word <i>adventure</i> has been
used in its broadest sense to cover not only strange
happenings in strange places but also love and life
and death&mdash;all things that have to do with the great
adventure of living.  Questions as to the fitness of a
story were settled by examining the qualities of the
narrative as such rather than by reference to a
technical classification of short stories.
</p>

<p>
It is the inalienable right of the editor of a work
of this kind to plead copyright difficulties in
extenuation for whatever faults it may possess.  We beg the
reader to believe that this is why his favorite story
was omitted while one vastly inferior was included.

THE SHIP THAT SAW A GHOST

<p class="t3">
FRANK NORRIS
</p>

<p>
Very much of this story must remain untold,
for the reason that if it were definitely known
what business I had aboard the tramp
steam-freighter <i>Glarus</i>, three hundred miles off the
South American coast on a certain summer's day,
some few years ago, I would very likely be obliged
to answer a great many personal and direct questions
put by fussy and impertinent experts in maritime
law&mdash;who are paid to be inquisitive.  Also, I would
get "Ally Bazan," Strokher and Hardenberg into
trouble.
</p>

<p>
Suppose on that certain summer's day, you had
asked of Lloyds's agency where the <i>Glarus</i> was, and
what was her destination and cargo.  You would
have been told that she was twenty days out from
Callao, bound North to San Francisco in ballast;
that she had been spoken by the bark <i>Medea</i> and
the steamer <i>Benevento</i>; that she was reported to
have blown out a cylinder head, but being
manageable was proceeding on her way under sail.
</p>

<p>
That is what Lloyds's would have answered.
</p>

<p>
If you know something of the ways of ships and
what is expected of them, you will understand that
the <i>Glarus</i>, to be some half a dozen hundred miles
south of where Lloyds's would have her, and to be
still going South, under full steam, was a scandal
that would have made her brothers and sisters
ostracize her finally and forever.
</p>

<p>
And that is curious, too.  Humans may indulge in
vagaries innumerable, and may go far afield in the
way of lying; but a ship may not so much as quibble
without suspicion.  The least lapse of "regularity,"
the least difficulty in squaring performance with
intuition, and behold she is on the black list, and her
captain, owners, officers, agents and consignors, and
even supercargoes, are asked to explain.
</p>

<p>
And the <i>Glarus</i> was already on the black list.
From the beginning her stars had been malign.  As
the <i>Breda</i>, she had first lost her reputation, seduced
into a filibustering escapade down the South American
coast, where in the end a plain-clothes United
States detective&mdash;that is to say, a revenue
cutter&mdash;arrested her off Buenos Ayres and brought her home,
a prodigal daughter, besmirched and disgraced.
</p>

<p>
After that she was in some dreadful blackbirding
business in a far quarter of the South Pacific; and
after that&mdash;her name changed finally to the
<i>Glarus</i>&mdash;poached seals for a syndicate of Dutchmen who
lived in Tacoma, and who afterward built a
clubhouse out of what she earned.
</p>

<p>
And after that we got her.
</p>

<p>
We got her, I say, through Ryder's South Pacific
Exploitation Company.  The "President" had
picked out a lovely little deal for Hardenberg,
Strokher and Ally Bazan (the Three Black Crows),
which he swore would make them "independent
rich" the rest of their respective lives.  It is a
promising deal (B. 300 it is on Ryder's map), and if you
want to know more about it you may write to ask
Ryder what B. 300 is.  If he chooses to tell you, that
is his affair.
</p>

<p>
For B. 300&mdash;let us confess it&mdash;is, as Hardenberg
puts it, as crooked as a dog's hind leg.  It is as risky
as barratry.  If you pull it off you may&mdash;after
paying Ryder his share&mdash;divide sixty-five, or possibly
sixty-seven, thousand dollars between you and your
associates.  If you fail, and you are perilously like
to fail, you will be sure to have a man or two of your
companions shot, maybe yourself obliged to pistol
certain people, and in the end fetch up at Tahiti,
prisoner in a French patrol-boat.
</p>

<p>
Observe that B. 300 is spoken of as still open.  It
is so, for the reason that the Three Black Crows did
not pull it off.  It still stands marked up in red ink
on the map that hangs over Ryder's desk in the
San Francisco office; and anyone can have a chance
at it who will meet Cyrus Ryder's terms.  Only he
can't get the <i>Glarus</i> for the attempt.
</p>

<p>
For the trip to the island after B. 300 was the last
occasion on which the <i>Glarus</i> will smell blue water or
taste the trades.  She will never clear again.  She is
lumber.
</p>

<p>
And yet the <i>Glarus</i> on this very blessed day of
1902 is riding to her buoys off Sausalito in San
Francisco Bay, complete in every detail (bar a broken
propeller shaft), not a rope missing, not a screw
loose, not a plank started&mdash;a perfectly equipped
steam freighter.
</p>

<p>
But you may go along the "Front" in San
Francisco from Fisherman's Wharf to the China
steamships' docks and shake your dollars under the
seamen's noses, and if you so much as whisper <i>Glarus</i>
they will edge suddenly off and look at you with
scared suspicion, and then, as like as not, walk
away without another word.  No pilot will take the
<i>Glarus</i> out; no captain will navigate her; no stoker
will feed her fires; no sailor will walk her decks.  The
<i>Glarus</i> is suspect.  She has seen a ghost.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It happened on our voyage to the island after this
same B. 300.  We had stood well off from shore for
day after day, and Hardenberg had shaped our
course so far from the track of navigation that since
the <i>Benevento</i> had hulled down and vanished over
the horizon no stitch of canvas nor smudge of smoke
had we seen.  We had passed the equator long since,
and would fetch a long circuit to the southard, and
bear up against the island by a circuitous route.
This to avoid being spoken.  It was tremendously
essential that the <i>Glarus</i> should not be spoken.
</p>

<p>
I suppose, no doubt, that it was the knowledge of
our isolation that impressed me with the dreadful
remoteness of our position.  Certainly the sea in
itself looks no different at a thousand than at a
hundred miles from shore.  But as day after day I
came out on deck at noon, after ascertaining our
position on the chart (a mere pin-point in a reach of
empty paper), the sight of the ocean weighed down
upon me with an infinitely great awesomeness&mdash;and
I was no new hand to high seas even then.
</p>

<p>
But at such times the <i>Glarus</i> seemed to me to be
threading a loneliness beyond all worlds and beyond
all conception desolate.  Even in more populous
waters, when no sail notches the line of the horizon,
the propinquity of one's kind is nevertheless a thing
understood, and to an unappreciated degree
comforting.  Here, however, I knew we were out, far
out in the desert.  Never a keel for years upon years
before us had parted these waters; never a sail had
bellied to these winds.  Perfunctorily, day in and
day out we turned our eyes through long habit
toward the horizon.  But we knew, before the look,
that the searching would be bootless.  Forever and
forever, under the pitiless sun and cold blue sky
stretched the indigo of the ocean floor.  The ether
between the planets can be no less empty, no less
void.
</p>

<p>
I never, till that moment, could have so much as
conceived the imagination of such loneliness, such
utter stagnant abomination of desolation.  In an
open boat, bereft of comrades, I should have gone
mad in thirty minutes.
</p>

<p>
I remember to have approximated the impression
of such empty immensity only once before, in my
younger days, when I lay on my back on a treeless,
bushless mountainside and stared up into the sky for
the better part of an hour.
</p>

<p>
You probably know the trick.  If you do not, you
must understand that if you look up at the blue
long enough, the flatness of the thing begins little by
little to expand, to give here and there; and the eye
travels on and on and up and up, till at length (well
for you that it lasts but the fraction of a second),
you all at once see space.  You generally stop there
and cry out, and&mdash;your hands over your eyes&mdash;are
only too glad to grovel close to the good old solid
earth again.  Just as I, so often on short voyage,
was glad to wrench my eyes away from that horrid
vacancy, to fasten them upon our sailless masts, and
stack, or to lay my grip upon the sooty smudged
taffrail of the only thing that stood between me and
the Outer Dark.
</p>

<p>
For we had come at last to that region of the Great
Seas where no ship goes, the silent sea of Coleridge
and the Ancient One, the unplumbed, untracked,
uncharted Dreadfulness, primordial, hushed, and we
were as much alone as a grain of star-dust whirling
in the empty space beyond Uranus and the ken of
the greater telescopes.
</p>

<p>
So the <i>Glarus</i> plodded and churned her way
onward.  Every day and all day the same pale-blue
sky and the unwinking sun bent over that
moving speck.  Every day and all day the same
black-blue water-world, untouched by any known
wind, smooth as a slab of syenite, colourful as an
opal, stretched out and around and beyond and
before and behind us, forever, illimitable, empty.
Every day the smoke of our fires veiled the streaked
whiteness of our wake.  Every day Hardenberg
(our skipper) at noon pricked a pin-hole in the
chart that hung in the wheel-house, and that showed
we were so much farther into the wilderness.  Every
day the world of men, of civilization, of newspapers,
policemen and street-railways receded, and we
steamed on alone, lost and forgotten in that silent
sea.
</p>

<p>
"Jolly lot o' room to turn raound in," observed
Ally Bazan, the colonial, "withaout steppin' on y'r
neighbour's toes."
</p>

<p>
"We're clean, clean out o' the track o' navigation,"
Hardenberg told him.  "An' a blessed good
thing for us, too.  Nobody ever comes down into
these waters.  Ye couldn't pick no course here.
Everything leads to nowhere."
</p>

<p>
"Might as well be in a bally balloon," said Strokher.
</p>

<p>
I shall not tell of the nature of the venture on
which the <i>Glarus</i> was bound, further than to say it
was not legitimate.  It had to do with an ill thing
done more than two centuries ago.  There was
money in the venture, but it was to be gained by
a violation of metes and bounds which are better
left intact.
</p>

<p>
The island toward which we were heading is
associated in the minds of men with a Horror.
A ship had called there once, two hundred years in
advance of the <i>Glarus</i>&mdash;a ship not much unlike the
crank high-prowed caravel of Hudson, and her
company had landed, and having accomplished
the evil they had set out to do, made shift to sail
away.  And then, just after the palms of the island
had sunk from sight below the water's edge, the
unspeakable had happened.  The Death that was
not Death had arisen from out the sea and stood
before the ship, and over it, and the blight of the
thing lay along the decks like mould, and the ship
sweated in the terror of that which is yet without
a name.
</p>

<p>
Twenty men died in the first week, all but six in
the second.  These six, with the shadow of insanity
upon them, made out to launch a boat, returned to
the island and died there, after leaving a record of
what had happened.
</p>

<p>
The six left the ship exactly as she was, sails all
set, lanterns all lit&mdash;left her in the shadow of the
Death that was not Death.
</p>

<p>
She stood there, becalmed, and watched them
go.  She was never heard of again.
</p>

<p>
Or was she&mdash;well, that's as may be.
</p>

<p>
But the main point of the whole affair, to my
notion, has always been this.  The ship was the
last friend of those six poor wretches who made
back for the island with their poor chests of plunder.
She was their guardian, as it were, would have
defended and befriended them to the last; and also
we, the Three Black Crows and myself, had no
right under heaven, nor before the law of men, to
come prying and peeping into this business&mdash;into
this affair of the dead and buried past.  There was
sacrilege in it.  We were no better than
body-snatchers.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
When I heard the others complaining of the
loneliness of our surroundings, I said nothing at
first.  I was no sailor man, and I was on board
only by tolerance.  But I looked again at the
maddening sameness of the horizon&mdash;the same
vacant, void horizon that we had seen now for
sixteen days on end, and felt in my wits and in my
nerves that same formless rebellion and protest
such as comes when the same note is reiterated
over and over again.
</p>

<p>
It may seem a little thing that the mere fact of
meeting with no other ship should have ground
down the edge of the spirit.  But let the
incredulous&mdash;bound upon such a hazard as ours&mdash;sail straight
into nothingness for sixteen days on end, seeing
nothing but the sun, hearing nothing but the thresh
of his own screw, and then put the question.
</p>

<p>
And yet, of all things, we desired no company.
Stealth was our one great aim.  But I think there
were moments&mdash;toward the last&mdash;when the Three
Crows would have welcomed even a cruiser.
</p>

<p>
Besides, there was more cause for depression,
after all, than mere isolation.
</p>

<p>
On the seventh day Hardenberg and I were forward
by the cat-head, adjusting the grain with some
half-formed intent of spearing the porpoises that of
late had begun to appear under our bows, and
Hardenberg had been computing the number of
days we were yet to run.
</p>

<p>
"We are some five hundred odd miles off that
island by now," he said, "and she's doing her
thirteen knots handsome.  All's well so far&mdash;but
do you know, I'd just as soon raise that point o'
land as soon as convenient."
</p>

<p>
"How so?" said I, bending on the line.  "Expect
some weather?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Dixon," said he, giving me a curious glance,
"the sea is a queer proposition, put it any ways.
I've been a seafarin' man since I was big as a minute,
and I know the sea, and what's more, the Feel o'
the sea.  Now, look out yonder.  Nothin', hey?
Nothin' but the same ol' skyline we've watched all
the way out.  The glass is as steady as a steeple,
and this ol' hooker, I reckon, is as sound as the
day she went off the ways.  But just the same
if I were to home now, a-foolin' about Gloucester
way in my little dough-dish&mdash;d'ye know what?  I'd
put into port.  I sure would.  Because why?
Because I got the Feel o' the Sea, Mr. Dixon.  I got
the Feel o' the Sea."
</p>

<p>
I had heard old skippers say something of this
before, and I cited to Hardenberg the experience
of a skipper captain I once knew who had turned
turtle in a calm sea off Trincomalee.  I asked him
what this Feel of the Sea was warning him against
just now (for on the high sea any premonition is a
premonition of evil, not of good).  But he was not
explicit.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," he answered moodily, and as if
in great perplexity, coiling the rope as he spoke.
"I don't know.  There's some blame thing or
other close to us, I'll bet a hat.  I don't know the
name of it, but there's a big Bird in the air, just out
of sight som'eres, and," he suddenly exclaimed,
smacking his knee and leaning forward,
"I&mdash;don't&mdash;like&mdash;it&mdash;one&mdash;dam'&mdash;bit."
</p>

<p>
The same thing came up in our talk in the cabin
that night, after the dinner was taken off and we
settled down to tobacco.  Only, at this time, Hardenberg
was on duty on the bridge.  It was Ally Bazan
who spoke instead.
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me," he hazarded, "as haow they's
somethin' or other a-goin' to bump up pretty blyme
soon.  I shouldn't be surprised, naow, y'know, if
we piled up on some bally uncharted reef along o'
to-night and went strite daown afore we'd had a
bloomin' charnce to s'y 'So long, gen'lemen all.'"
</p>

<p>
He laughed as he spoke, but when, just at that
moment, a pan clattered in the galley, he jumped
suddenly with an oath, and looked hard about the
cabin.
</p>

<p>
Then Strokher confessed to a sense of distress
also.  He'd been having it since day before
yesterday, it seemed.
</p>

<p>
"And I put it to you the glass is lovely," he said,
"so it's no blow.  I guess," he continued, "we're
all a bit seedy and ship-sore."
</p>

<p>
And whether or not this talk worked upon my
own nerves, or whether in very truth the Feel of
the Sea had found me also, I do not know; but I do
know that after dinner that night, just before going
to bed, a queer sense of apprehension came upon me,
and that when I had come to my stateroom, after
my turn upon deck, I became furiously angry with
nobody in particular, because I could not at once
find the matches.  But here was a difference.  The
other man had been merely vaguely uncomfortable.
I could put a name to my uneasiness.  I felt that
we were being watched.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was a strange ship's company we made after
that.  I speak only of the Crows and myself.  We
carried a scant crew of stokers, and there was also a
chief engineer.  But we saw so little of him that
he did not count.  The Crows and I gloomed on the
quarterdeck from dawn to dark, silent, irritable,
working upon each other's nerves till the creak of a
block would make a man jump like cold steel laid
to his flesh.  We quarrelled over absolute nothings,
glowered at each other for half a word, and each one
of us, at different times, was at some pains to declare
that never in the course of his career had he been
associated with such a disagreeable trio of brutes.
Yet we were always together, and sought each
other's company with painful insistence.
</p>

<p>
Only once were we all agreed, and that was when
the cook, a Chinaman, spoiled a certain batch of
biscuits.  Unanimously we fell foul of the creature
with as much vociferation as fishwives till he fled
the cabin in actual fear of mishandling, leaving us
suddenly seized with noisy hilarity&mdash;for the first
time in a week.  Hardenberg proposed a round of
drinks from our single remaining case of beer.  We
stood up and formed an Elk's chain and then drained
our glasses to each other's health with profound
seriousness.
</p>

<p>
That same evening, I remember, we all sat on the
quarterdeck till late and&mdash;oddly enough&mdash;related
each one his life's history up to date; and then went
down to the cabin for a game of euchre before turning in.
</p>

<p>
We had left Strokher on the bridge&mdash;it was his
watch&mdash;and had forgotten all about him in the
interest of the game, when&mdash;I suppose it was about
one in the morning&mdash;I heard him whistle long and
shrill.  I laid down my cards and said:
</p>

<p>
"Hark!"
</p>

<p>
In the silence that followed we heard at first only
the muffled lope of our engines, the cadenced snorting
of the exhaust, and the ticking of Hardenberg's
big watch in his waistcoat that he had hung by the
arm-hole to the back of his chair.  Then from the
bridge, above our deck, prolonged, intoned&mdash;a
wailing cry in the night&mdash;came Strokher's voice:
</p>

<p>
"Sailoh-h-h!"
</p>

<p>
And the cards fell from our hands, and, like men
turned to stone, we sat looking at each other across
the soiled red cloth for what seemed an immeasurably
long minute.
</p>

<p>
Then stumbling and swearing, in a hysteria of
hurry, we gained the deck.
</p>

<p>
There was a moon, very low and reddish, but no
wind.  The sea beyond the taffrail was as smooth as
lava, and so still that the swells from the cutwater
of the <i>Glarus</i> did not break as they rolled away from
the bows.
</p>

<p>
I remember that I stood staring and blinking at
the empty ocean&mdash;where the moonlight lay like a
painted stripe reaching to the horizon&mdash;stupid and
frowning, till Hardenberg, who had gone on ahead,
cried:
</p>

<p>
"Not here&mdash;on the bridge!"
</p>

<p>
We joined Strokher, and as I came up the others
were asking:
</p>

<p>
"Where?  Where?"
</p>

<p>
And there, before he had pointed, I saw&mdash;we all
of us saw&mdash;&mdash;  And I heard Hardenberg's teeth
come together like a spring trap, while Ally Bazan
ducked as though to a blow, muttering:
</p>

<p>
"Gord 'a' mercy, what nyme do ye put to a ship
like that?"
</p>

<p>
And after that no one spoke for a long minute,
and we stood there, moveless black shadows, huddled
together for the sake of the blessed elbow touch that
means so incalculably much, looking off over our
port quarter.
</p>

<p>
For the ship that we saw there&mdash;oh, she was not
a half-mile distant&mdash;was unlike any ship known to
present day construction.
</p>

<p>
She was short, and high-pooped, and her stern,
which was turned a little toward us, we could see,
was set with curious windows, not unlike a house.
And on either side of this stern were two great iron
cressets such as once were used to burn signal-fires
in.  She had three masts with mighty yards swung
'thwart-ship, but bare of all sails save a few rotting
streamers.  Here and there about her a tangled mass
of rigging drooped and sagged.
</p>

<p>
And there she lay, in the red eye of the setting
moon, in that solitary ocean, shadowy, antique,
forlorn, a thing the most abandoned, the most sinister
I ever remember to have seen.
</p>

<p>
Then Strokher began to explain volubly and with
many repetitions.
</p>

<p>
"A derelict, of course.  I was asleep; yes, I was
asleep.  Gross neglect of duty.  I say I was
asleep&mdash;on watch.  And we worked up to her.  When I
woke, why&mdash;you see, when I woke, there she was,"
he gave a weak little laugh, "and&mdash;and now, why,
there she is, you see.  I turned around and saw her
sudden like&mdash;when I woke up, that is."
</p>

<p>
He laughed again, and as he laughed the engines
far below our feet gave a sudden hiccough.  Something
crashed and struck the ship's sides till we
lurched as we stood.  There was a shriek of steam, a
shout&mdash;and then silence.
</p>

<p>
The noise of the machinery ceased; the <i>Glarus</i>
slid through the still water, moving only by her own
decreasing momentum.
</p>

<p>
Hardenberg sang, "Stand by!" and called down
the tube to the engine-room.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?"
</p>

<p>
I was standing close enough to him to hear the
answer in a small, faint voice:
</p>

<p>
"Shaft gone, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Broke?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Hardenberg faced about.
</p>

<p>
"Come below.  We must talk."  I do not think
any of us cast a glance at the Other Ship again.
Certainly I kept my eyes away from her.  But as
we started down the companionway I laid my hand
on Strokher's shoulder.  The rest were ahead.  I
looked him straight between the eyes as I asked:
</p>

<p>
"Were you asleep?  Is that why you saw her so
suddenly?"
</p>

<p>
It is now five years since I asked the question.  I
am still waiting for Strokher's answer.
</p>

<p>
Well, our shaft was broken.  That was flat.  We
went down into the engine-room and saw the jagged
fracture that was the symbol of our broken hopes.
And in the course of the next five minutes' conversation
with the chief we found that, as we had not
provided against such a contingency, there was to
be no mending of it.  We said nothing about the
mishap coinciding with the appearance of the Other
Ship.  But I know we did not consider the break with
any degree of surprise after a few moments.
</p>

<p>
We came up from the engine-room and sat down
to the cabin table.
</p>

<p>
"Now what?" said Hardenberg, by way of beginning.
</p>

<p>
Nobody answered at first.
</p>

<p>
It was by now three in the morning.  I recall it all
perfectly.  The ports opposite where I sat were open
and I could see.  The moon was all but full set.  The
dawn was coming up with a copper murkiness over
the edge of the world.  All the stars were yet out.
The sea, for all the red moon and copper dawn, was
gray, and there, less than half a mile away, still lay
our consort.  I could see her through the portholes
with each slow careening of the <i>Glarus</i>.  "I vote for
the island," cried Ally Bazan, "shaft or no shaft.
We rigs a bit o' syle, y'know&mdash;&mdash;" and thereat the
discussion began.
</p>

<p>
For upward of two hours it raged, with loud words
and shaken forefingers, and great noisy bangings of
the table, and how it would have ended I do not
know, but at last&mdash;it was then maybe five in the
morning&mdash;the lookout passed word down to the
cabin:
</p>

<p>
"Will you come on deck, gentlemen?"  It was the
mate who spoke, and the man was shaken&mdash;I could
see that&mdash;to the very vitals of him.  We started and
stared at one another, and I watched little Ally
Bazan go slowly white to the lips.  And even then
no word of the ship, except as it might be this from
Hardenberg:
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  Good God Almighty, I'm no coward,
but this thing is getting one too many for me."
</p>

<p>
Then without further speech he went on deck.
</p>

<p>
The air was cool.  The sun was not yet up.  It was
that strange, queer mid-period between dark and
dawn, when the night is over and the day not yet
come, just the gray that is neither light nor dark,
the dim dead blink as of the refracted light from
extinct worlds.
</p>

<p>
We stood at the rail.  We did not speak; we stood
watching.  It was so still that the drip of steam from
some loosened pipe far below was plainly audible,
and it sounded in that lifeless, silent grayness
like&mdash;God knows what&mdash;a death tick.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said the mate, speaking just above a
whisper, "there's no mistake about it.  She is
moving&mdash;this way."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a current, of course," Strokher tried to say
cheerfully, "sets her toward us."
</p>

<p>
Would the morning never come?
</p>

<p>
Ally Bazan&mdash;his parents were Catholic&mdash;began to
mutter to himself.
</p>

<p>
Then Hardenberg spoke aloud.
</p>

<p>
"I particularly don't want&mdash;that&mdash;out&mdash;there&mdash;to
cross our bows.  I don't want it to come to that.  We
must get some sails on her."
</p>

<p>
"And I put it to you as man to man," said Strokher,
"where might be your wind."
</p>

<p>
He was right.  The <i>Glarus</i> floated in absolute
calm.  On all that slab of ocean nothing moved but
the Dead Ship.
</p>

<p>
She came on slowly; her bows, the high, clumsy
bows pointed toward us, the water turning from her
forefoot.  She came on; she was near at hand.  We
saw her plainly&mdash;saw the rotted planks, the crumbling
rigging, the rust-corroded metal-work, the broken
rail, the gaping deck, and I could imagine that the
clean water broke away from her sides in refluent
wavelets as though in recoil from a thing unclean.
She made no sound.  No single thing stirred aboard
the hulk of her&mdash;but she moved.
</p>

<p>
We were helpless.  The <i>Glarus</i> could stir no boat in
any direction; we were chained to the spot.  Nobody
had thought to put out our lights, and they still
burned on through the dawn, strangely out of place
in their red-and-green garishness, like maskers
surprised by daylight.
</p>

<p>
And in the silence of that empty ocean, in that
queer half-light between dawn and day, at six
o'clock, silent as the settling of the dead to the
bottomless bottom of the ocean, gray as fog, lonely,
blind, soulless, voiceless, the Dead Ship crossed our
bows.
</p>

<p>
I do not know how long after this the Ship
disappeared, or what was the time of day when we at
last pulled ourselves together.  But we came to
some sort of decision at last.  This was to go
on&mdash;under sail.  We were too close to the island now
to turn back for&mdash;for a broken shaft.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was spent fitting on the sails to her,
and when after nightfall the wind at length came up
fresh and favourable, I believe we all felt heartened
and a deal more hardy&mdash;until the last canvas went
aloft, and Hardenberg took the wheel.  We had
drifted a good deal since the morning, and the bows
of the <i>Glarus</i> were pointed homeward, but as soon
as the breeze blew strong enough to get steerageway
Hardenberg put the wheel over and, as the booms
swung across the deck, headed for the island again.
</p>

<p>
We had not gone on this course half an hour&mdash;no,
not twenty minutes&mdash;before the wind shifted a
whole quarter of the compass and took the <i>Glarus</i>
square in the teeth, so that there was nothing for it
but to tack.  And then the strangest thing befell.
</p>

<p>
I will make allowance for the fact that there was
no centre-board nor keel to speak of to the <i>Glarus</i>.
I will admit that the sails upon a nine-hundred-ton
freighter are not calculated to speed her, nor
steady her.  I will even admit the possibility of a
current that set from the island toward us.  All this
may be true, yet the <i>Glarus</i> should have advanced.
We should have made a wake.
</p>

<p>
And instead of this, our stolid, steady, trusty
old boat was&mdash;what shall I say?
</p>

<p>
I will say that no man may thoroughly understand
a ship&mdash;after all.  I will say that new ships
are cranky and unsteady; that old and seasoned
ships have their little crotchets, their little
fussinesses that their skippers must learn and humour
if they are to get anything out of them; that even
the best ships may sulk at times, shirk their work,
grow unstable, perverse, and refuse to answer helm
and handling.  And I will say that some ships
that for years have sailed blue water as soberly and
as docilely as a street-car horse has plodded the
treadmill of the 'tween-tracks, have been known to
balk, as stubbornly and as conclusively as any old
Bay Billy that ever wore a bell.  I know this has
happened, because I have seen it.  I saw, for
instance, the <i>Glarus</i> do it.
</p>

<p>
Quite literally and truly we could do nothing
with her.  We will say, if you like, that that great
jar and wrench when the shaft gave way shook her
and crippled her.  It is true however, that
whatever the cause may have been, we could not force
her toward the island.  Of course, we all said
"current"; but why didn't the log-line trail?
</p>

<p>
For three days and three nights we tried it.  And
the <i>Glarus</i> heaved and plunged and shook herself
just as you have seen a horse plunge and rear when
his rider tries to force him at the steam-roller.
</p>

<p>
I tell you I could feel the fabric of her tremble
and shudder from bow to stern-post, as though she
were in a storm; I tell you she fell off from the wind,
and broad-on drifted back from her course till the
sensation of her shrinking was as plain as her own
staring lights and a thing pitiful to see.
</p>

<p>
We roweled her, and we crowded sail upon her,
and we coaxed and bullied and humoured her, till
the Three Crows, their fortune only a plain sail two
days ahead, raved and swore like insensate brutes,
or shall we say like mahouts trying to drive their
stricken elephant upon the tiger&mdash;and all to no
purpose.  "Damn the damned current and the
damned luck and the damned shaft and all,"
Hardenberg would exclaim, as from the wheel he would
catch the <i>Glarus</i> falling off.  "Go on, you old
hooker&mdash;you tub of junk!  My God, you'd think
she was scared!"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the <i>Glarus</i> was scared, perhaps not; that
point is debatable.  But it was beyond doubt of
debate that Hardenberg was scared.
</p>

<p>
A ship that will not obey is only one degree less
terrible than a mutinous crew.  And we were in a
fair way to have both.  The stokers, whom we had
impressed into duty as A.B.'s, were of course
superstitious; and they knew how the <i>Glarus</i> was acting,
and it was only a question of time before they got
out of hand.
</p>

<p>
That was the end.  We held a final conference
in the cabin and decided that there was no help for
it&mdash;we must turn back.
</p>

<p>
And back we accordingly turned, and at once
the wind followed us, and the "current" helped us,
and the water churned under the forefoot of the
<i>Glarus</i>, and the wake whitened under her stern,
and the log-line ran out from the trail and strained
back as the ship worked homeward.
</p>

<p>
We had never a mishap from the time we finally
swung her about; and, considering the circumstances,
the voyage back to San Francisco was propitious.
</p>

<p>
But an incident happened just after we had started
back.  We were perhaps some five miles on the
homeward track.  It was early evening and
Strokher had the watch.  At about seven o'clock he
called me up on the bridge.
</p>

<p>
"See her?" he said.
</p>

<p>
And there, far behind us, in the shadow of the
twilight, loomed the Other Ship again, desolate,
lonely beyond words.  We were leaving her rapidly
astern.  Strokher and I stood looking at her till she
dwindled to a dot.  Then Strokher said:
</p>

<p>
"She's on post again."
</p>

<p>
And when months afterward we limped into the
Golden Gate and cast anchor off the "Front" our
crew went ashore as soon as discharged, and in half a
dozen hours the legend was in every sailors'
boarding-house and in every seaman's dive, from Barbary
Coast to Black Tom's.
</p>

<p>
It is still there, and that is why no pilot will
take the <i>Glarus</i> out, no captain will navigate her,
no stoker feed her fires, no sailor walk her decks.
The <i>Glarus</i> is suspect.  She will never smell blue
water again, nor taste the trades.  She has seen
a Ghost.

<p>
The <i>Justitia</i> was a smart little barque of 395
tons.  I had viewed her with something
of admiration as she lay in mid-stream in
the Hooghly&mdash;somewhere off the Coolie Bazaar,
I think it was.  There was steam then coming to
Calcutta, though not as steam now is; very little of
it was in any sense palatial, and some of the very
best of it was to be as promptly distanced under
given conditions of weather by certain of the
clippers, clouded with studding sails and flying-kites
to the starry buttons of their skysail mastheads, as
the six-knot ocean tramp of to-day is to be outrun
by the four-masted leviathan thrashing through it to
windward with her yards fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
I&mdash;representing in those days a large Birmingham
firm of dealers in the fal-lal industries&mdash;had wished
to make my way from Calcutta to Capetown.  I
saw the <i>Justitia</i> and took a fancy to her; I admired
the long, low, piratic run of her hull as she lay with
straining hawsepipes on the rushing stream of the
Hooghly; upon which, as you watched, there
might go by in the space of an hour some half-score
at least of dead natives made ghastly canoes
of by huge birds, erect upon the corpses, burying
their beaks as they sailed along.
</p>

<p>
I found out that the <i>Justitia</i> was one of the
smartest of the Thames and East India traders of that
time, memorable on one occasion for having reeled
off a clean seventeen knots by the log under a main
topgallant-sail, set over a single-reefed topsail.  It
was murmured, indeed, that the mate who hove
that log was drunk when he counted the knots;
yet the dead reckoning tallied with the next day's
observations.  I called upon the agents, was told
that the <i>Justitia</i> was not a passenger ship, but that
I could hire a cabin for the run to Capetown if I
chose; a sum of rupees, trifling compared with the
cost of transit by steam, was named.  I went on
board, found the captain walking up and down
under the awning, and agreeably killed an hour in a
chat with as amiable a seaman as ever it was my
good fortune to meet.
</p>

<p>
We sailed in the middle of July.  Nothing worth
talking about happened during our run down the
Bay of Bengal.  The crew aforemast were all of
them Englishmen; there were twelve, counting cook
and steward.  The captain was a man named
Cayzer; the only mate of the vessel was one William
Perkins.  The boatswain, a rough, short, hairy,
immensely strong man, acted as second mate and
kept a lookout when Perkins was below.  But he
was entirely ignorant of navigation, and owned
to me that he read with difficulty words of one
syllable, and could not write.
</p>

<p>
I was the only passenger.  My name, I may as
well say here, is Thomas Barren.  Our run to the
south Ceylon parallels was slow and disappointing.
The monsoon was light and treacherous, sometimes
dying out in a sort of laughing, mocking gust till
the whole ocean was a sheet-calm surface, as though
the dependable trade wind was never again to blow.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Captain Cayzer to me, "we're
used to the unexpected hereabouts.  Monsoon or
no monsoon, I'll tell you what: you're always safe
in standing by for an Irishman's hurricane down
here."
</p>

<p>
"And what sort of a breeze is that?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"An up-and-down calm," said he, "as hard to
know where it begins as to guess where it'll end."
</p>

<p>
However, thanks to the frequent trade puffs and
other winds, which tasted not like the monsoon, we
crawled through those latitudes which Ceylon spans,
and fetched within a few degrees of the equator.  In
this part of the waters we were to be thankful for
even the most trifling donation of a catspaw, or for
the equally small and short-lived mercy of the gust
of the electric cloud.  I forget how many days we
were out from Calcutta: the matter is of no moment.
I left my cabin one morning some hour after the sun
had risen, by which time the decks had been washed
down, and were already dry, with a salt sparkle as of
bright white sand on the face of the planks, so
roasting was it.  I went into the head to get a bath under
the pump there.  I feel in memory, as I write, the
exquisite sensation of that luxury of brilliant brine,
cold as snow, melting through me from head to foot
to the nimble plying of the pump-brake by a seaman.
</p>

<p>
It was a true tropic morning.  The sea, of a pale
lilac, flowed in a long-drawn, gentle heave of swell
into the southwest; the glare of the early morning
brooded in a sort of steamy whiteness in the atmosphere;
the sea went working to its distant reaches,
and floated into a dim blending of liquid air and
water, so that you couldn't tell where the sky ended;
a weak, hot wind blew over the taffrail, but it was
without weight.  The courses swung to the swell
without response to the breathings of the air; and
on high the light cotton-white royals were scarcely
curved by the delicate passage of the draught.
</p>

<p>
Yet the barque had steerage way.  When I looked
through the grating at her metalled forefoot I saw
the ripples plentiful as harp strings threading aft,
and whilst I dried myself I watched the slow
approach of a piece of timber hoary with barnacles,
and venerable with long hairs of seaweed, amid and
around which a thousand little fish were sporting,
many-coloured as though a rainbow had been shivered.
</p>

<p>
I returned to my cabin, dressed, and stepped on
the quarter-deck, where I found some men spreading
the awning, and the captain in a white straw hat
viewing an object out upon the water through a
telescope, and talking to the boatswain, who stood
alongside.
</p>

<p>
"What do you see?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Something that resembles a raft," answered the
captain.
</p>

<p>
The thing he looked at was about a mile distant,
some three points on the starboard bow.  On pointing
the telescope, I distinctly made out the fabric of
a raft, fitted with a short mast, to which midway a
bundle&mdash;it resembled a parcel&mdash;was attached.  A
portion of the raft was covered by a white sheet or
cloth, whence dangled a short length of something
chocolate-coloured, indistinguishable even with the
glass, lifting and sinking as the raft rose and fell upon
the flowing heave of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"This ocean," said the captain, taking the glass
from me, "is a big volume of tragic stories, and the
artist who illustrates the book does it in that
fashion," and he nodded in the direction of the raft.
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it, boatswain?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"It looks to me," he answered in his strong, harsh,
deep voice, "like a religious job&mdash;one of them rafts
the Burmuh covies float away their dead on.  I
never seen one afore, sir, but I've heard tell of such
things."
</p>

<p>
We sneaked stealthily toward the raft.  It was
seven bells&mdash;half-past seven&mdash;and the sailors ate
their breakfast on the forecastle, that they might
view the strange contrivance.  The mate, Mr. Perkins,
came on deck to relieve the boatswain, and,
after inspecting the raft through the telescope, gave
it as his opinion that it was a Malay floating bier&mdash;"a
Mussulman trick of ocean burial, anyhow," said
he.  "There should be a jar of water aboard the raft,
and cakes and fruit for the corpse to regale on, if he
ha'n't been dead long."
</p>

<p>
The steward announced breakfast; the captain
told him to hold it back awhile.  He was as curious
as I to get a close view of the queer object with its
white cloth and mast and parcel half out like a
barge's leeboard, and he bade the man at the helm
put the wheel over by a spoke or two; but the wind
was nearly gone, the barque scarcely responded to
the motion of her rudder, the thread-like lines at
the cutwater had faded, and a roasting, oppressive
calm was upon the water, whitening it out into a
tingling sheen of quicksilver with a fiery shaft of
blinding dazzle, solitary and splendid, working with
the swell like some monstrous serpent of light right
under the sun.
</p>

<p>
The raft was about six cables' lengths off us when
the barque came to a dead stand, with a soft,
universal hollowing in of her canvas from royal to
course, as though, like something sentient, she
delivered one final sigh before the swoon of the calm
seized her.  But now we were near enough to resolve
the floating thing with the naked eye into details.
It was a raft formed of bamboo canes.  A mast about
six feet tall was erected upon it; the dark thing over
the edge proved a human leg, and, when the fabric
lifted with the swell and raised the leg clear, we
saw the foot had been eaten away by fish, a number
of which were swimming about the raft, sending
little flashes of foam over the pale surface as they
darted along with their back or dorsal fins exposed.
They were all little fish; I saw no sharks.  The
body to which the leg belonged was covered by a
white cloth.  The captain called my attention to
the parcel attached to the mast, and said that it
possibly contained the food which the Malays leave
beside their dead after burial.
</p>

<p>
"But let's go to breakfast now, Mr. Barren,"
said he, with a slow, reproachful, impatient look
round the breathless scene of ocean.  "If there's
any amusement to be got out of that thing yonder
there's a precious long, quiet day before us, I fear,
for the entertainment."
</p>

<p>
We breakfasted, and due course returned on deck.
The slewing of the barque had caused the raft to
shift its bearings, otherwise its distance remained as
it was when we went below.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Perkins," said the captain, "lower a boat
and bring aboard that parcel from the raft's jury-mast,
and likewise take a peep at the figure under
the cloth, and report its sex and what it looks like."
</p>

<p>
I asked leave to go in the boat, and when she was
lowered, with three men in her, I followed
Mr. Perkins, and we rowed over to the raft.  All about
the frail contrivance the water was beautiful with
the colors and movements of innumerable fish.  As
we approached we were greeted by an evil smell.
The raft seemed to have been afloat for a
considerable period; its submerged portion was green
with marine adhesions or growths.  The fellow in
the bows of the boat, manoeuvring with the boat-hook,
cleverly snicked the parcel from the jury-mast
and put it beside him without opening it, for that was
to be the captain's privilege.
</p>

<p>
"Off with that cloth," said Mr. Perkins, "and
then backwater a bit out of this atmosphere."
</p>

<p>
The bowman jerked the cloth clear of the raft
with his boathook; the white sheet floated like a
snowflake upon the water for a few breaths, then
slowly sank.  The body exposed was stark naked
and tawny.  It was a male.  I saw nothing revolting
in the thing: it would have been otherwise perhaps
had it been white.  The hair was long and black, the
nose aquiline, the mouth puckered into the aspect
of a harelip; the gleam of a few white teeth painted
a ghastly contemptuous grin upon the dead face.
The only shocking part was the footless leg.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I hook him overboard, sir?" said the bow-man.
</p>

<p>
"No, let him take his ease as he lies," answered
the mate, and with that we returned to the barque.
</p>

<p>
We climbed over the side, the boat was hoisted to
the davits, and Mr. Perkins took the parcel out of
the stern-sheets and handed it to the captain.  The
cover was a kind of fine canvas, very neatly stitched
with white thread.  Captain Cayzer ripped through
the stitching with his knife, and exposed a couple
of books bound in some kind of skin or parchment.
They were probably the Koran, but the characters
none of us knew.  The captain turned them about
for a bit, and I stood by looking at them; he then
replaced them in their canvas cover and put them
down upon the skylight, and by-and-by, on his
leaving the deck, he took them below to his
cabin.
</p>

<p>
The moon rose about ten that night.  She came
up hot, distorted, with a sullen face belted with
vapor, but was soon clear of the dewy thickness over
the horizon and showering a pure greenish silver
upon the sea.  She made the night lovely and cool;
her reflection sparkled in the dew along the rails,
and her beam whitened out the canvas into the
tender softness of wreaths of cloud motionless upon
the summit of some dark heap of mountain.  I
looked for the raft and saw it plainly, and it is not
in language to express how the sight of that frail
cradle of death deepened the universal silence and
expanded the prodigious distances defined by the
stars, and accentuated the tremendous spirit of
loneliness that slept like a presence in that wide region
of sea and air.
</p>

<p>
There had not been a stir of wind all day: not the
faintest breathing of breeze had tarnished the sea
down to the hour of midnight when, feeling weary,
I withdrew to my cabin.  I slept well, in spite of the
heat and the cockroaches, and rose at seven.  I
found the steward in the cabin.  His face wore a
look of concern, and on seeing me he instantly
exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The captain seems very ill, sir.  Might you know
anything of physic?  Neither Mr. Perkins nor me
can make out what's the matter."
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of physic," I answered, "but
I'll look in on him."
</p>

<p>
I stepped to his door, knocked, and entered.
Captain Cayzer lay in a bunk under a middling-sized
porthole; the cabin was full of the morning light.  I
started and stood at gaze, scarce crediting my sight,
so shocked and astounded was I by the dreadful
change which had happened in the night in the poor
man's appearance.  His face was blue, and I
remarked a cadaverous sinking of the eyeballs; the
lips were livid, the hands likewise blue, but strangely
wrinkled like a washer-woman's.  On seeing me he
asked in a husky whispering voice for a drink of
water.  I handed him a full panikin, which he
drained feverishly, and then began to moan and
cry out, making some weak miserable efforts to rub
first one arm, then the other, then his legs.
</p>

<p>
The steward stood in the doorway.  I turned to
him, sensible that my face was ashen and asked some
question.  I then said, "Where is Mr. Perkins?"  He
was on deck.  I bade the steward attend to the
captain, and passed through the hatch to the
quarter-deck, where I found the mate.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know that the captain is very ill?"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"Do I know it, sir?  Why, yes.  I've been sitting
by him chafing his limbs and giving him water to
drink, and attending to him in other ways.  What is
it, d'ye know, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Cholera!</i>" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God, I hope not!" he exclaimed.  "How
could it be cholera.  How could cholera come
aboard?"
</p>

<p>
"A friend of mine died of cholera at Rangoon
when I was there," said I.  "I recognize the looks,
and will swear to the symptoms."
</p>

<p>
"But how could it have come aboard?" he
exclaimed, in a voice low but agitated.
</p>

<p>
My eyes, as he asked the question, were upon
the raft.  I started and cried, "Is that thing still
there?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said the mate, "we haven't budged a
foot all night."
</p>

<p>
The suspicion rushed upon me whilst I looked
at the raft, and ran my eyes over the bright hot
morning sky and the burnished surface of sea,
sheeting into dimness in the misty junction of
heaven and water.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised," said I, "to discover
that we brought the cholera aboard with us
yesterday from that dead man's raft yonder."
</p>

<p>
"How is cholera to be caught in that fashion?"
exclaimed Mr. Perkins, pale and a bit wild in his
way of staring at me.
</p>

<p>
"We may have brought the poison aboard in the
parcel of books."
</p>

<p>
"Is cholera to be caught so?"
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly.  The disease may be propagated
by human intercourse.  Why not then by books
which have been handled by cholera-poisoned
people, or by the atmosphere of a body dead of the
plague?" I added, pointing at the raft.
</p>

<p>
"No man amongst us is safe, then, now?" cried
the mate.
</p>

<p>
"I'm no doctor," said I, "but I know this, that
contagious poisons such as scarlet fever and glanders,
may retain their properties in a dormant state
for years.  I've heard tell of scores of instances of
cholera being propagated through articles of dress.
Depend upon it," said I, "that we brought the
poison aboard with us yesterday from that accursed
death-raft yonder."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't the books in the captain's cabin?" said
the mate.
</p>

<p>
"Are they?"
</p>

<p>
"He took them below yesterday, sir."
</p>

<p>
"The sooner they're overboard the better," I
exclaimed, and returned to the cabin.
</p>

<p>
I went to the captain, and found the steward
rubbing him.  The disease appeared to be doing
its work with horrible rapidity; the eyes were deeply
sunk and red; every feature had grown sharp and
pinched as after a long wasting disease; the
complexion was thick and muddy.  Those who have
watched beside cholera know that terrific changes
may take place in a few minutes.  I cast my eyes
about for the parcel of books, and, spying it, took a
stick from a corner of the berth, hooked up the
parcel, and, passing it through the open porthole,
shook it overboard.
</p>

<p>
The captain followed my movements with a
languid rolling of his eyes but spoke not, though he
groaned often, and frequently cried out.  I could
not in the least imagine what was proper to be done.
His was the most important life on board the ship,
and yet I could only look on and helplessly watch
him expire.
</p>

<p>
He lived till the evening, and seldom spoke save
to call upon God to release him.  I had found an
opportunity to tell him that he was ill of the cholera,
and explained how it happened that the horrible
distemper was on board, for I was absolutely sure
we had brought it with us in that parcel of books;
but his anguish was so keen, his death so close then,
that I cannot be sure he understood me.  He died
shortly after seven o'clock, and I have since learned
that that time is one of the critical hours in cholera.
</p>

<p>
When the captain was dead I went to the mate,
and advised him to cast the body overboard at
once.  He called to some of the hands.  They
brought the body out just as the poor fellow had
died, and, securing a weight to the feet, they lifted
the corpse over the rail, and dropped it.  No burial
was read.  We were all too panic-stricken for
reverence.  We got rid of the body quickly, the men
handling the thing as though they felt the death in it
stealing into them through their fingers&mdash;hoping
and praying that with it the cholera would go.  It
was almost dark when this hurried funeral was
ended.  I stood beside the mate, looking around
the sea for a shadow of wind in any quarter.  The
boatswain, who had been one of the men that
handled the body, came up to us.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't there nothing to be done with that corpus
out there?" he exclaimed, pointing with a square
hand to the raft.  "The men are agreed that there'll
come no wind whilst that there dead blackie keeps
afloat.  And ain't he enough to make a disease of
the hatmosphere itself, from horizon to horizon?"
</p>

<p>
I waited for the mate to answer.  He said gloomily,
"I'm of the poor captain's mind.  You'll need to
make something fast to the body to sink it.  Who's
to handle it?  I'll ask no man to do what I wouldn't
do myself, and rat me if I'd do that!"
</p>

<p>
"We brought the poison aboard by visiting the
raft, bo'sw'n," said I.  "Best leave the thing alone.
The corpse is too far off to corrupt the air, as you
suppose; though the imagination's nigh as bad as
the reality," said I, spitting.
</p>

<p>
"If there's any of them game to sink the thing,
may they do it?" said the boatswain.  "For if
ther's ne'er a breeze of wind to come while it's
there&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Chaw!" said the mate.  "But try 'em, if you
will.  They may take the boat when the moon's
up, should there come no wind first."
</p>

<p>
An hour later the steward told me that two of the
sailors were seized with cramps and convulsions.
After this no more was said about taking the boat
and sinking the body.  The mate went into the
forecastle.  On his return, he begged me to go and
look at the men.
</p>

<p>
"Better make sure that it's cholera with them
too, sir," said he.  "You know the signs;" and,
folding his arms, he leaned against the bulwarks in a
posture of profound dejection.
</p>

<p>
I went forward and descended the forescuttle,
and found myself in a small cave.  The heat was
over-powering; there was no air to pass through
the little hatch; the place was dimly lighted by an
evil-smelling lamp hanging under a beam but, poor
as the illumination was, I could see by it, and when
I looked at the men and spoke to them, I saw how
it was, and came away sick at heart, and half dead
with the hot foul air of the forecastle, and in deepest
distress of mind, moreover, through perceiving
that the two men had formed a part of the crew of
the boat when we visited the raft.
</p>

<p>
One died at six o'clock next morning, and the
other at noon; but before this second man was
dead three others had been attacked, and one of
them was the mate.  And still never a breath of
air stirred the silver surface of the sea.
</p>

<p>
The mate was a strong man, and his fear of death
made the conflict dreadful to behold.  I was paralyzed
at first by the suddenness of the thing and the
tremendous character of our calamity, and, never
doubting that I must speedily prove a victim as
being one who had gone in the boat, I cast myself
down upon a sofa in the cabin and there sat, waiting
for the first signal of pain, sometimes praying, or
striving to pray, and seeking hard to accustom my
mind to the fate I regarded as inevitable.  But a
keen and biting sense of my cowardice came to
my rescue.  I sprang to my feet and went to the
mate's berth, and nursed him till he died, which
was shortly before midnight of the day of his
seizure&mdash;so swift and sure was the poison we had brought
from the raft.  He was dropped over the side, and
a few hours later he was followed by three others.
I cannot be sure of my figures: it was a time of
delirium, and I recall some details of it with
difficulty, but I am pretty sure that by the morning of
the fourth day of our falling in with the accursed
raft the ship's company had been reduced to the
boatswain and five men, making, with myself,
seven survivors of fifteen souls who had sailed from
Calcutta.
</p>

<p>
It was some time about the middle of the fifth
day&mdash;two men were lying stricken in the forecastle&mdash;the
boatswain and a couple of seamen came aft to
the quarter-deck where I was standing.  The wheel
was deserted: no man had grasped it since the
captain's death; indeed, there was nothing to be
done at the helm.  The ocean floated in liquid
glass; the smell of frying paint, bubbled into cinders
by the roasting rays, rose like the stench of a second
plague to the nostrils.  The boatswain and his
companions had been drinking; no doubt they had
broached the rum casks below.  They had never
entered the cabin to my knowledge nor do I believe
they got their liquor from there.  The boatswain
carried a heavy weight of some sort, bound in
canvas, with a long lanyard attached to it.  He
flung the parcel into the quarter-boat, and roared
out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If that don't drag the blistered cuss out of sight
I'll show the fired carcass the road myself.  Cholera
or no cholera, here goes!"
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Do?" he cried; "why sink that there plague out
of it, so as to give us a chance of a breeze.  Ain't this
hell's delight?  What's a-going to blow us clear
whilst <i>he</i> keeps watch?"  And he nodded with a
fierce drunken gesture toward the raft.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to handle the body to sink it,"
said I.  "You're well men, now; keep well, won't
you?  The two who are going may be next taken."
</p>

<p>
The three of them roared out drunkenly together,
so muddling their speech with oaths that I did not
understand them.  I walked aft, not liking their
savage looks.  Shouting and cursing plentifully, they
lowered the boat, got into her by descending the
falls, and shoved off for the raft.  They drew alongside
the bamboo contrivance, and I looked to see the
boat capsize, so wildly did they sway her in their
wrath and drink as they fastened the weight to the
foot of the body.  They then sank the corpse and
with the loom of their oars, hammered at the raft till
the bamboos were scattered like a sheaf of walking-sticks
cut adrift.  They now returned to the barque,
clambered aboard, and hoisted the boat.
</p>

<p>
The two sick men in the forecastle were at this
time looked after by a seaman named Archer.  I
have said it was the fifth day of the calm; of the
ship's company the boatswain and five men were
living, but two were dying and that, not counting
me, left three as yet well and able to get about.
</p>

<p>
This man Archer, when the boatswain and his
companions went forward, came out of the forecastle,
and drank at the scuttle-butt in the waist.  He
walked unsteadily, with that effort after stateliness
which is peculiar to tipsy sailors; his eyes wandered,
and he found some difficulty in hitting the bunghole
with the dipper.  Yet he was a civil sort of man
when sober; I had occasionally chatted with him
during his tricks at the wheel; and, feeling the need
of some one to talk to about our frightful situation, I
walked up to him, and asked him how the sick men
did.
</p>

<p>
"Dying fast," he answered, steadying himself by
leaning against the scuttle-butt, "and a-ravin' like
screetch owls."
</p>

<p>
"What's to be done, Archer?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God alone He knows!" answered the man,
and here he put his knuckles into his eyes, and began
to cry and sob.
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible that this calm can last much
longer?"
</p>

<p>
"It may last six weeks," he answered, whimpering.
"Down here, when the wind's drawed away by the
sun, it may take six weeks afore it comes on to a blow.
Six weeks of calm down here ain't thought nothen
of," and here he burst out blubbering again.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you get your liquor from?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't talk of it!" he replied, with a maudlin
shake of the head.
</p>

<p>
"Drinking'll not help you," said I; "you'll be
all the likelier to catch the malady for drinking.
This is a sort of time, I should think, when a man
most wants his senses.  A breeze may come, and we
ought to decide where to steer the barque to.  The
vessel's under all plain sail, too, and here we are,
four men and a useless passenger, should it come on
to blow suddenly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We didn't sign on under you," he interrupted,
with a tipsy scowl, "and as ye ain't no good either as
a sailor or doctor, you can keep your blooming
sarmons to yourself till they're asked for."
</p>

<p>
I had now not only to fear the cholera but to dread
the men.  My mental distress was beyond all power
of words to convey: I wonder it did not quickly
drive me crazy and hurry me overboard.  I lurked
in the cabin to be out of sight of the fellows, and all
the while my imagination was tormenting me with
first pangs of the cholera, and every minute I was
believing I had the mortal malady.  Sometimes I
would creep up the companion steps and cautiously
peer around, and always I beheld the same dead,
faint blue surface of the sea stretching like an ocean
in a dream into the faint indefinable distances.  But
shocking as that calm was to me, I very well knew
there was nothing wonderful or preternatural in it.
Our forefoot five days before had struck the equatorial
zone called the Doldrums, and at a period of the
year when a fortnight or even a month of atmospheric
lifelessness might be as confidently looked for
as the rising and setting of the sun.
</p>

<p>
At nine o'clock that night I was sitting at the
cabin table with biscuit and a little weak brandy
and water before me, when I was hailed by some one
at the open skylight above.  It was black night,
though the sky was glorious with stars: the moon
did not rise till after eleven.  I had lighted the cabin
lamp, and the sheen of it was upon the face of
Archer.
</p>

<p>
"The two men are dead and gone," said he, "and
now the bo'sun and Bill are down.  There's Jim dead
drunk in his hammock.  I can't stand the cries of
sick men.  What with liquor and pain, the air below
suffocates me.  Let me come aft, sir, and keep along
with you.  I'm sober now.  Oh, Christ, have mercy
upon me!  It's my turn next, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
I passed a glass of brandy to him through the skylight,
then joined him on deck, and told him that the
two dead bodies must be thrown overboard, and the
sick men looked to.  For some time he refused to go
forward with me, saying that he was already
poisoned and deadly sick, and a dying man, and that I
had no right to expect that one dying man should
wait upon another.  However, I was determined to
turn the dead out of the ship in any case, for in
freeing the vessel of the remains of the victims might lie
my salvation.  He consented to help me at last, and
we went into the forecastle and between us got the
bodies out of their bunks, and dropped them,
weighted, over the rail.  The boatswain and the other
men lay groaning and writhing and crying for
water; cursing at intervals.  A coil of black smoke
went up from the lamp flame to the blackened beam
under which the light was burning.  The atmosphere
was horrible.  I bade Archer help me to carry a
couple of mattresses on to the forecastle, and we got
the sick men through the hatch, and they lay there
in the coolness with plenty of cold water beside them
and a heaven of stars above, instead of a low-pitched
ceiling of grimy beam and plank dark with processions
of cockroaches, and dim with the smoke of the
stinking slush lamp.
</p>

<p>
All this occupied us till about half-past ten.  When
I went aft I was seized with nausea, and, sinking
upon the skylight, dabbled my brow in the dew
betwixt the lifted lids for the refreshment of the
moisture.  I believed that my time had come, and
that this sickness was the cholera.  Archer followed
me, and seeing me in a posture of torment, as he
supposed, concluded that I was a dead man.  He flung
himself upon the deck with a groan, and lay motionless,
crying out at intervals, "God, have mercy!
God, have mercy!" and that was all.
</p>

<p>
In about half an hour's time the sensation of
sickness passed.  I went below for some brandy,
swallowed half a glass, and returned with a dram for
Archer, but the man had either swooned or fallen
asleep, and I let him lie.  I had my senses perfectly,
but felt shockingly weak in body, and I could think
of nothing consolatory to diminish my exquisite
distress of mind.  Indeed, the capacity of realization
grew unendurably poignant.  I imagined too well, I
figured too clearly.  I pictured myself as lying dead
upon the deck of the barque, found a corpse by some
passing vessel after many days; and so I dreamt,
often breaking away from my horrible imaginations
with moans and starts, then pacing the deck to rid
me of the nightmare hag of thought till I was in a
fever, then cooling my head by laying my cheek
upon the dew-covered skylight.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by the moon rose, and I sat watching it.
In half an hour she was a bright light in the east,
and the shaft of silver that slept under her stretched
to the barque's side.  It was just then that one of
the two sick men on the forecastle sent up a yell.
The dreadful note rang through the vessel, and
dropped back to the deck in an echo from the canvas.
A moment after I saw a figure get on to the
forecastle-rail and spring overboard.  I heard the
splash of his body, and, bounding over to Archer,
who lay on the deck, I pulled and hauled at him,
roaring out that one of the sick men had jumped
overboard, and then rushed forward and looked over
into the water in the place where the man had leapt,
but saw nothing, not even a ripple.
</p>

<p>
I turned and peered close at the man who lay on
the forecastle, and discovered that the fellow who
had jumped was the boatswain.  I went again to
the rail to look, and lifted a coil of rope from a pin,
ready to fling the fakes to the man, should he rise.
The moonlight was streaming along the ocean on
this side of the ship, and now, when I leaned over
the rail for the second time, I saw a figure close
under the bows.  I stared a minute or two, the colour
of the body blended with the gloom, yet the moonlight
was upon him too, and then it was that after
looking awhile, and observing the thing to lie
motionless, I perceived that it was the body that had
been upon the raft!  No doubt the extreme horror
raised in me by the sight of the poisonous thing
beheld in that light and under such conditions crazed
me.  I have recollection of laughing wildly, and
defying the dark floating shape in insane language.
I remember that I shook my fist and spat at it, and
that I turned to seek for something to hurl at the
body, and it may have been that in the instant of
turning, my senses left me, for after this I can recall
no more.
</p>

<p>
The sequel to this tragic and extraordinary experience
will be found in the following statement, made
by the people of the ship <i>Forfarshire</i>, from Calcutta
to Liverpool:&mdash;"August 29, 1857.  When in latitude
2° 15' N. and longitude 79° 40' E. we sighted a
barque under all plain sail, apparently abandoned.
The breeze was very scanty, and though we immediately
shifted our helm for her on judging that she was
in distress, it took us all the morning to approach her
within hailing distance.  Everything was deserted,
and there were no signs of anything living in her.  We
sent a boat in charge of the second officer, who
returned and informed us that the barque was the
<i>Justitia</i>, of London.  We knew that she was from
Calcutta, for we had seen her lying in the river.
The second officer stated that there were three dead
bodies aboard, one in a hammock in the forecastle,
a second on a mattress on the forecastle, and a third
against the coamings of the main-hatch; there was
also a fourth man lying at the heel of the port
cathead&mdash;he did not seem to be dead.  On this
Dr. Davison was requested to visit the barque, and he
was put aboard by the second officer.  He returned
quickly with one of the men, whom he instantly
ordered to be stripped and put into a warm bath,
and his clothes thrown overboard.  He said that the
dead showed unmistakable signs of having died
from cholera.  We proceeded, not deeming it prudent
to have anything further to do with the ill-fated
craft.  The person we had rescued remained insensible
for two days; his recovery was then slow, but
sure, thanks to the skilful treatment of Dr. Davison.
He informed us that his name was Thomas Barron,
and that he was a passenger on board the <i>Justitia</i>
for Capetown.  He was the travelling representative
of a large Birmingham firm.  The barque had on the
preceding Friday fallen in with a raft bearing
a dead body.  A boat was sent to bring away a parcel
from the raft's mast, and it is supposed that the
contents of the parcel communicated the cholera.
There were fifteen souls when the vessel left Calcutta,
and all perished except the passenger, Thomas
Barron."

<p>
Three dirty and breathless soldiers scrambled
painfully through a gap in the hedge on
the brow of the rounded slope of the hill and,
taking out their maps and field-glasses, lay down
prone on their stomachs.  So dirty were they that it
was hard to realize that they were officers.  Placing
both elbows squarely on the ground, to counteract
the unsteadiness of hand caused by their heaving
bodies, their thumbs were soon busily twisting the
focussing-screws as they directed their glasses on to
a large patch of scrub away below, some three miles
to the west.  On a rise in this rough country a long
line of intermittent flashes could be seen with the
naked eye.
</p>

<p>
The hedge stretched for some distance along the
brow of the hill.  About one hundred yards behind,
and parallel to it, between hazel hedges, ran a
country road.  This&mdash;hardly more than a lane&mdash;was, to
the south of this point, sunken, but just here was
flush with the ground.  On the near side of it,
immediately behind where the officers were lying, was
an open gate, and close to this gate a young poplar
tree, against which was propped a motor-bicycle.
In the lane itself were a motor-cyclist and a couple
of orderlies, the latter dismounted and holding the
horses of the party.  Down below, in the direction
in which the three were gazing, stretched a peaceful
panorama of undulating country, fading into bluish
heat-haze in the distance.  The different crops gave
a many-hued appearance to the landscape, the richer
colour of the uncut hay alternating with the still
crude green of the young grain and the reddish
purple of the beetroot fields.  The few fleecy clouds
floating lazily in the sky here and there cast vague
shadows, which slowly moved over hill and dale.
The white walls and shining roofs of the homesteads
dotted about stood out gleaming in the sunlight,
and these, with the patches of woodland, caught the
eye and assisted in some estimation of distance,
otherwise impossible upon the variegated
background with its network of hedges.
</p>

<p>
It was an almost perfect day in early June.  Yet,
in spite of the brilliant sunshine, there was an
oppressive sultriness in the air which gave more than
a hint of a coming storm.
</p>

<p>
Far off, in the same positions they had occupied
all day, hung three war-balloons, motionless in the
still air.  They were of a curious shape, and as the
sun glistened on their distended skins they had the
appearance of three monstrous and bloated yellow
caterpillars.  Upon the youngest of the three men
under the hedge they had a disquieting effect of
oppression.  He felt that they were the eyes of the
enemy&mdash;as indeed they were&mdash;and was uneasy under
their silent gaze; at times he even imagined that
those menacing eyes could read not only his actions,
but his very thoughts and desires.
</p>

<p>
Though the elements seemed at peace, there was
clear evidence that man was not, for here and there
could be seen the angry glow of a conflagration with
its pall of black smoke.  In places the dirty-white
dust-clouds betrayed the movement of masses,
though the masses were not visible, while over
certain spots thick clusters of smoke-puffs, suddenly
breaking out like signal flags from the halliards of a
ship, showed where shrapnel shell were raining down
destruction.  These puffs were of different
colours&mdash;the majority pure white, but others were of a
purple and magenta hue as violet as aniline dyes.  An
occasional bright flash, followed by a dull detonation
and an upshooting trefoil of black smoke,
marked the fall of high-explosive shell.  From the
clamour that filled the air, one might have imagined
that the whole countryside formed one large shipyard
or boilermaker's shop, so metallic was the
sound of musketry close at hand.  Every moment
this body of sound was stabbed by the nearer
rifle-shots which rang out separately, and broken by the
occasional throb of machine-guns, the mechanical
beat of pom-poms, and the booming of artillery.
But to an ear used to the noise of battles, there
was one fresh sound&mdash;that of the quick-firing field-guns;
for as they seized some fleeting occasion to
pour out their squalls of shell, individual shots could
not be distinguished in the continuous roar.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding this din in the air, it was difficult
to see any signs of life.  Of the work of man
there was ample evidence; but of man himself&mdash;save
those on the hill&mdash;there was no trace.  Had a
curious observer, however, walked some way down the
bellying slope of the hill, he would have seen the
backs of a long line of infantry digging for dear life
near the bottom.
</p>

<p>
From all this turmoil down below, the little group
at the top of the hill seemed strangely detached.
No shell flew screeching over their heads, no bullet
sang near them&mdash;they gazed on undisturbed.  At
last one put down his glasses and sat up with a
grunt.
</p>

<p>
"We've been looking at the wrong place all along.
We've been watching their flashes and bluff trenches
on that rise.  The guns are using flameless powder,
and are a good deal closer&mdash;more to the left of the
rough.  I can just make them out, but cannot see
how many there are."
</p>

<p>
"I can't see anything except the flashes which
appear just where the trenches are," replied a second.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, that's their game!  D'you see
that red and white farm?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Above that there's some water."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Above that, still more to the left, on that hump
covered with&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I have them now; I should say there
was more than one battery.  They don't seem to
be entrenched, either; but it is hard to tell on that
background."
</p>

<p>
"There are more like twenty guns there,"
continued the first.  "You may be certain they're
entrenched&mdash;they're no fools.  They have shown the
dummies and hidden the real emplacements, which
would not require much work on such a place as
that&mdash;an ideal spot for guns."
</p>

<p>
"And so is this," added the third, the youngest
of the three.  "If it were not for their balloons, we
could get a whole brigade up here unseen all the
way, and suddenly open fire from behind this hedge.
Even if they are entrenched, we could enfilade them
and give them a bad time&mdash;enough to keep them
quiet.  If they're not, Lord help them, once we
start!"  He chuckled softly, and muttered fervently
to himself, "Yes, Lord help them!"  He was a
Gunner.
</p>

<p>
He stared for a minute at the nearest balloon,
silently and in deep thought, then taking off his
hat, began absently to mop his head.  Suddenly he
stopped quite still, his head turned to one side as
if listening.
</p>

<p>
"My God! it is rising!"
</p>

<p>
The two gazed at him in blank amaze, and,
startled, at once seized their repeating-pistols.
</p>

<p>
"The wind, I mean&mdash;the wind.  I feel it on my
damp head!"
</p>

<p>
They still looked blank.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see?  If the wind only rises, down go
those cursed balloons, and then&mdash;"  There was no
need to finish the sentence.  The others jumped to
their feet; one sucked his finger and held it up; the
other picked a puff-ball and threw it in the air; all
watched it gently wafted up the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, look over there; that's more than haze&mdash;it's cloud!"
</p>

<p>
Toward the west there was now a low bank of
gray cloud stretched across the horizon, against
which the intermittent flashes showed bright.
</p>

<p>
"Whistle up the cyclist!" snapped out the eldest
of the three, sitting down with notebook and pencil.
</p>

<p>
As the cyclist came up, he said, "Take this as
quick as possible to the General of the 10th
Division: he must be found; but if on the way you get
near the officer commanding the Corps Artillery,
show it to him and say I want him to read it."
</p>

<p>
After a minute they heard, as they got up, the
snort of the motor breasting a rise on their left, and
after three minutes there was nothing but the reek
of petrol to show that any one had been on that
hilltop.
</p>

<p>
They had gone and no one had noticed two small
scoops in the ground&mdash;one under the hedge and the
other farther along near the road&mdash;where ranging
shell had fallen.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
The wind has risen with the coming storm, and,
above, the white clouds begin to chase each other
across the blue sky.  Out in the open and on the
hilltops the trees are stricken by gusts of wind which
rob the hawthorns of the last of their bloom.  In
the sheltered valleys there is peace and quiet, and
under the lee of the hill the sultriness of the whole
morning seems to have been concentrated.
</p>

<p>
The artillery brigade has now been waiting some
time in that hollow lane between the high banks
covered with wildflowers.  Long enough to breathe
the panting gun-teams, and for some of the gunners
to dismount and pluck dog-roses, which they have
stuck in their hats.
</p>

<p>
The still air in this little heat-trap, heavy with
the smell of horses and the overpowering scent of
May-blossom strewn on the ground, combined with
the drowsy buzzing of the bumblebees&mdash;the gentle
murmur of a hot summer's day&mdash;has a somnolent
effect on all except the animals, as they stand there
zigzagged across the lane, the guns and limbers
slewed to ease the strain.  They present a succession
of shiny quivering skins, and tails switching in
a vain endeavour to drive off the hovering swarms
of flies who divided their attention between the
backs of the men and the horses.  Though there is
no conversation, for the men&mdash;here and there chewing
a biscuit or taking a sparing drink from their
water-bottles&mdash;are all tired, yet there is a general
air of pleasurable expectancy, for the nature of
their present errand is now known to all.  It is their
first experience of active service, and the event now
awaited is to be their baptism of fire.  In the minds
of the more serious, a slight though vague feeling
of apprehension&mdash;running like the coloured thread
through the lay of a rope&mdash;adds zest to their
suppressed excitement, for many and wonderful have
been the yarns going the round of the barrack-rooms
as to the powers of the enemy's quick-firing
artillery.  Here a more phlegmatic man has lit his pipe
and wastefully thrown the match away, to burn to
the end among the nettles on the bank&mdash;a thing
which alone is sufficient to show that these are the
early days of operations.
</p>

<p>
How the sun's rays pour down between the trees!
How mercilessly they betray, even through the
cloud of dust still hanging in the air, a hint of the
more unpleasant side of war!  The weary and lathered
horses, the red and strained faces of the men,
their peeled noses, the little runnels made in the
grime on their cheeks by the perspiration as it
streams down, the purple sweat-patches in the
greenish-yellow uniform.  Now and again, as if
maliciously to accentuate the contrast between its
dainty self and the crowd of men and animals
sweating below, a pale butterfly flits aimlessly in
and out of the shadows&mdash;sometimes nearly, but
never quite, settling on a horse or gun.
</p>

<p>
The windings of the lane only permit a view of
some hundred yards of its length at one time; but
even this short distance offers an impressive sight.
It is apparent, in spite of the dust and dirt, that the
greater number of these men&mdash;some still on their
horses, some standing, and some stretched out on
the shady side of the road&mdash;are seasoned and in the
prime of life; no mere boys, but men in the best
sense of the word, sturdy and full-set.  Even for
gunners they are a fine lot; and during this lull
preceding the coming storm, the sight of this little
collection of splendid men and horses raises thoughts
as to whether any other army in the world can
produce their equal.  Both men and animals are the
last word in continuous training and scientific
preparation applied to picked material.  Not only are
they good to look upon, but good to act.  From the
showy prettiness of a tournament driving competition
to the serious business of getting on to the target,
they excel; for here at this moment is collected
the smartest brigade of field-artillery in the
army&mdash;and that means, as they think, the smartest brigade
in the world: they are armed also with the best
guns in the world.  There stand the guns one after
another slewed across the narrow road, almost blocking
it with their length.  Wicked they look in their
dusty greenish paint, with an occasional glint of
steel where it has been scraped off.  Even to the
uninitiated these quick-firers have a more venomous
appearance than the simple old guns; for, with their
long, low-hung bodies peering mysteriously from
behind their shields, they look like monstrous
grasshoppers crouching on a hill.  Ugly and venomous
looking, they are the pride of their owners.  Though
he may not talk much about it, never has there
been a true gunner who did not love his weapon and
thrill with the idea of using it.
</p>

<p>
To those, now a little thoughtful on account of
the legends concerning the enemy's wonderful quick-firing
artillery, the sight of their own, whose powers
they have so often tested on the practice-ground, is
reassuring.  They have the best gun ever invented,
and at speed of ranging and accuracy of fire they
are unequalled.  What more?  Are they not going
to catch the enemy unawares?  And to be caught
unawares by a squall of shrapnel from modern
quick-firers means extinction.
</p>

<p>
To the officers, the exact nature of the present
task is known, and the possibilities of the occasion
better appreciated&mdash;for though as yet without
personal experience in war, they know to what a pitch
all the nations have brought their quick-firing
artillery, and what is expected from its "<i>rafales</i>," "<i>tir
rapide</i>," "<i>schnell feuer</i>"&mdash;call it what you
will&mdash;upon an exposed and unsuspecting enemy.  They
are standing alongside the horses, one feeling his
animal's legs, another loosening a girth, but the
majority cheerfully talking in little groups.
</p>

<p>
At last the dreary wait is over, a flag flickers from
one hill to the other.  "The enemy's balloons are
down."  With a sigh of relief the order is passed,
and the brigade moves on, slowly at first, then
breaking into a trot, for its destination is still some
way off, and time, tide, and the chances for
quick-firing artillery wait for no man.
</p>

<p>
The message has come down from the youngest of
the three officers who were making the reconnaissance
under the hedge two hours ago.  For the past
hour he has been watching those malignant balloons
from that same spot, and whistling for the wind.
As the wind has risen, so have his spirits.  It is a
difficult thing to gauge the height of an object in
the air, and several times he has thought that the
balloon nearest the enemy's guns seems lower than
it was, only to find out he is wrong.
</p>

<p>
The cloud-bank to the west grows larger, and as
its ragged edge creeps up over the blue sky, the
dark background shows up the glistening balloons
the more brilliantly.  The two farthest off are
coming down&mdash;there is no doubt about it&mdash;and at last
the nearer one seems lower.  Yes&mdash;it is!  Down,
down it sinks.  When it is quite close to the ground
he waves to a signaller behind the road, who passes
on the message, and so back it goes to the waiting
brigade.
</p>

<p>
He crawls behind the hedge for a moment to
watch the range-takers, who have been up here for
the past half-hour and have taken and checked and
rechecked the distance to the enemy's guns.  Some
men with tools also, who have uprooted the gate-posts,
and widened some openings from the lane on
to the hilltop, are now cutting little windows through
the hedge on the brow.  A few officers arrive ahead
of the batteries, and to these he points out their
positions and the target and range.
</p>

<p>
All is ready, and the head of the column is even
now jangling up the hill.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
III
</p>

<p>
The same landscape as watched by the three
under the hedge, but viewed from the other side.
In the foreground, half hidden among the patches
of gorse on a gentle slope, is a long irregular line of
perhaps twenty guns.  It is difficult even at this
short distance to count their number, for they are
dotted about here and there amongst the clumps of
cover.  Though of a grayer hue, they have a strong
family resemblance to those others resting in the
little lane on the hillside.  By each is a water-bucket,
the purpose of which is shown by the damp
earth round the gun, and the absence of dust.
Alongside also are little shelter-pits dug for the gun
detachments, the bright yellow of the freshly turned
earth artfully concealed with pieces of bush.  The
guns, the limbers, and the very horses themselves&mdash;over
there in the rear&mdash;are embowered in greenery.
The incongruous Jack-in-the-Green appearance thus
given to these engines of destruction seems at first
ill-timed foolery.  It strikes a jarring note, as does
laughter in the presence of death.  Overhead, to one
side of the line of guns, a huge yellow balloon sways
in the rising wind and strains at the cable which
slants away down to a small collection of wagons in
a convenient hollow.
</p>

<p>
To the general din of battle all round is periodically
added the roar of some of the guns in the line
as a target worthy of a "<i>rafale</i>" of shell is found.
The paroxysms of noise indulged in at intervals by
these quick-firers are the only sign they give of their
action, for they neither belch out flame nor kick
up dust.  Each fresh outburst seems to call up an
echo from the direction of some absurdly
ill-concealed earthworks about half a mile to the rear.
The enemy are shooting badly.  Few shells fall
near the guns, though many pass over with a shriek
to burst in the neighbourhood of those conspicuous
earthworks, whose parapet must be a very shell
trap, so continuous are the explosions on it.  An
occasional heavy shell rumbles up from the South,
and, passing over with the noise of an electric tram,
detonates in a fountain of yellow earth near the
same target.
</p>

<p>
Near the focus of these explosions are a number
of men sitting at the bottom of deep holes, and from
their occupation it appears that not all the explosions
so close to them are caused by hostile shell.
They are busily employed in setting off flash bombs
just outside their yellow parapet whenever their
own artillery fires.  And as two more shrapnel
from different directions whistle high above the
much-decorated guns, and burst over the pits, it is
clear that the latter are the targets aimed at.
</p>

<p>
This is the method in the madness of these troglodytes
in their pits and of the other stage effects.
</p>

<p>
Some little way from his guns is a dried-up saturnine
sort of man, dirty and anything but smart&mdash;the
commander of the artillery.  He is talking to a
staff-officer, with occasional pauses as he stoops to
gaze through a telescope mounted on a tripod, not
to the southeast, in which direction his guns are
firing, but toward the hills to the east.  Close by sits
another officer at a field telephone in a hole in the
ground; such work is at the present moment too
important for an orderly.  From the instrument a
cable, sagging from one bush to another in loops,
leads toward the wagons near the balloon anchorage:
this cable is the nerve leading from the eye up aloft
to the nerve centre below.  A few soldiers are
sitting about.  Not only do these men wear a
different uniform from those other gunners now
perspiring on that hillside, but they are
unmistakably of a different race.
</p>

<p>
The Commander again takes a long look toward
the hills where something seems to excite his
apprehension, for he converses earnestly with the
staff-officer, and the two look more than once toward a
poplar tree the top half of which is visible above that
hill on the East.  The wind increases.
</p>

<p>
The distant balloons are already gradually
descending, and a message shortly comes down from
the observer above that it is too windy to remain up.
The word is given, and slowly the great mass is
hauled down to the depression near the wagons,
where it is practically hidden, its approach to the
ground being the occasion of special attentions from
the enemy.  Here, like Gulliver among the
Lilliputians, it is seized by many hands and bound.
Hardly has it nestled, with much heaving of billowy
sides, into its hollow, when the eye is attracted by
something dancing up and down among the brushwood
close to it.  It is an oblong framework, partially
covered with dirty gray canvas, which has
commenced to make sundry abortive little swoops
up into the air, ending in abrupt dives down again
to earth.  Finally this weird kite&mdash;for kite it
is&mdash;makes up its mind and sails steadily upward to the
tune of its whining cable-drum.  Up, up it goes,
holding well in the strong breeze till it becomes a
mere speck in the sky.  Another kite follows, then
another, and again one more, threaded on the same
cable, till with the combined pull it is stretched as
taut as a piano wire, and hums in the breeze like
the weather mainstay of a racing yacht.
</p>

<p>
The Commander walks over to the starting-point
of the kites, where, sitting near an exaggerated
clothes-basket, is a young officer.  He is unshaven,
his face is pale and drawn, and he appears worn out
as he sips slowly from the cup of his flask, but as his
senior approaches, he rises, salutes, and listens
attentively to his somewhat lengthy instructions.  He
is an exceptionally slight man, and his general air of
fatigue is explained by the fact that he has been
observing from the balloon for the past three hours;
the dark rings under his eyes show where the
constant strain has most told.  In spite of this he is
again to go up in the kite, not because there is none
other capable, but because the advantage of having
up aloft a pair of eyes that already know the lie of
the country is at the present juncture of greater
importance than the fatigue of any man.
</p>

<p>
As the Commander concludes his harangue, a shell
bursts on the ground close to him, covering him with
sand.  He does not pause to shake the sand off, but
finishes his sentence: "Of course it is a chance, but
they may not notice you go up against this cloudy
background, and may be tempted to take up that
position by seeing the balloon go down.  If they do,
well&mdash;" and he looks toward his guns and smiles
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
The younger man nods, takes one more pull at
his flask, feels if both pairs of field-glasses are
hanging round his neck&mdash;he carries two&mdash;straps a
telephone receiver and mouthpiece round his head, and
climbs into the clothes-basket which is held by the
men.  The basket is attached to the rigid kite cable
by runners.  After the gear is tried, another large
kite, which is harnessed to his prosaic-looking chariot,
is thrown into the air.  Making one or two ineffectual
dives, it catches the wind and begins to
pull.  Slowly at first the observer rises, then faster
as the great wings above him catch more of the
breeze.  Now they feel it, and up he sails like a
pantomime stormfiend, to the accompanying moan
of the wire vibrating in the wind.  In a few moments
he is a stationary spot far up on the slanting wire.
</p>

<p>
How insignificant in contrast to the great bulk of
the balloon does the whole collection of kites
appear&mdash;yet&mdash;the eye is there.

<p>
The commanding officer goes back to his station
by the telephone, and waits.  Prrrrrt, grumbles the
instrument, and this time it is he himself who takes
the receiver.  He listens attentively, for it is difficult
to hear along an aerial line, and there is much
repetition before he finally replies "All right!" to his
subordinate up above.  A word to a staff-officer,
who at once waves to some one near the guns.  Then
ensues much activity.  Within three minutes every
muzzle has been switched round by hand so as to
face the hills on the East, at half a right angle from its
former direction.  The gun-layers at once start
laying at the range obtained by those few shots fired
some hours back, and buckets are emptied on the
ground, but no effort is made to dig shelters, for they
will be unnecessary.  The exposure of and loss to
be caused by the new position is ignored.  When all
are at their stations ready to open fire, a whistle
sounds.
</p>

<p>
The suppressed excitement is catching.  That the
Commander himself is not unaffected is shown from
the manner in which he ostentatiously, and with
almost too great deliberation, selects a cigar from
his case and begins chewing the end of it....
</p>

<p>
"Prrrrrt," rattles the telephone: the Commander
drops the chewed cigar and listens.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready?" gurgles down the wire.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"The head of their column is not far off the
poplar tree."
</p>

<p>
A pause.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, on the hilltop, the watcher has again
sat down.  Now there is nothing to watch in the
sky, he sets himself to study the enemy's guns,
amongst which he seems vaguely to discover some
movement.  Can they have suspected anything?
As he sweeps his glass carelessly across the gray
cloud toward its terrestrial object, something&mdash;a
midge probably&mdash;in the upper corner of the object-glass
catches his eye.  He puts down the glass and
rubs the lens with his handkerchief.  He looks
again.  The midge is still there.  He looks directly
at it&mdash;it is a collection of midges.  Good God!
These are no midges&mdash;they are a covey of war kites
high up in the sky!  Yes, and there is the observer
hanging some distance below, who must have seen
all!
</p>

<p>
By this time two or three guns have turned out
of the lane and are unlimbering.
</p>

<p>
He rises and tries to shout&mdash;it is too late.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Now they're turning out of the road, through
three or four gaps, to come into action&mdash;now two
guns have left the road&mdash;hullo!&mdash;are you there?"
continues the thin metallic voice down the wire.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Let them have it."
</p>

<p>
The Commander, from his lowly position, looks
up and nods to a signaller standing up on a mound;
the latter drops his flag.
</p>

<p>
The air is split by the noise of the whole line of
guns as they open rapid fire.  It is like the report of
one piece prolonged into a continuous long note.
</p>

<p>
Upon the brow of that hill of doom, hiding the
sky-line for perhaps 400 yards to the right of the
now obscured poplar, appears a crown of magenta-coloured
smoke, out of which a succession of light
flashes sparkle.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
By those up on that hill is heard a faint roar in
the distance, followed by a whistling sound, and the
air above&mdash;all round&mdash;is full of crackling reports,
shouts, oaths, and groans.  Bullets tear the earth
on all sides, and the steel gun-shields ring out like
gongs under their blows.  Everything except the
dreadful sounds becomes blurred in the puffs of
acrid, tinted smoke which the wind drives across the
hilltop.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In a minute, automatically, the fire ceases&mdash;a long
period for quick-firing guns which pour out fifteen
shells a minute, and much ammunition, but this is an
opportunity given by the gods.
</p>

<p>
The Commander puts the telephone to his lips:
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!&mdash;is that enough?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute.  My God!  It is."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
V
</p>

<p>
Not one return shot has been fired.
</p>

<p>
The smoke is dissipated by the wind as soon as
the squall of shell ceases, and the scene of the
butchery stands revealed.
</p>

<p>
Behind the hedge are three guns unharmed except
for splintered wood.  Their green tint is all mottled
with oval patches of shining silver, plated by the
metal of the glancing bullets.  Men are lying about
singly, nearly all wounded in the head, and nearly
all dead.  A few who still crouch paralyzed behind
the shields seem unhurt.  Horses lie tied together by
their harness in kicking, screaming bunches.  At
the gateway is a tangle of capsized gun, limber, man,
and beast, which entirely blocks that part of the lane.
</p>

<p>
This is an <i>abattoir</i> better undescribed in detail&mdash;a
medley of dead and dying men and animals, and of
vehicles jammed into a solid mass.  At intervals guns
lie upturned or wedged across.  The mass still
struggles and heaves.  Here and there drivers have
half succeeded in driving their guns up the bank, in a
gallant attempt to get out of the shambles, with the
result that the horses lie dead on the top, and the
guns lie overturned in the hollow.  A few unharmed
and dazed officers and men still shout orders and
shove and push at the guns.  There, where an ammunition
wagon, hit direct by a shell, has exploded, is a
cleared space.  Branches and twigs are splintered in
all directions, and the shrapnel balls have stripped
the leaves from the trees and scattered a sparse
shower of green over their handiwork.
</p>

<p>
Though at least one of the shells has not burst
exactly, for on its back, under the hedge on the brow
of the hill, lies the headless body of the young gunner
officer&mdash;the glasses still in his left hand, a
handkerchief in the right&mdash;yet, as the small voice had
squeaked down the telephone wire 5000 yards away&mdash;it
<i>is</i> enough!

<p>
The lights of Dunkirk slipped rearward,
vibrating like a lantern at a ship's stern.
They became a vague yellow splotch, like a
hazy harvest moon; they became a dim halo, and
narrowed down to an orange pin-point, like a
smoker's match in a fog.  Ypres showed southward in a
pale aureole.  Afar off the guns of Flanders
thundered like drums.
</p>

<p>
Meriwell, as he leaned over the middle car of the
dirigible, lowering his masked head to the wind,
watched the black country skim by as if it were
being pulled along by a rope.  A spring wind cut
past like a hurricane, and in it Meriwell could taste
the sharp tang of gunpowder mingled with the scent
of April flowers.  Ypres flashed by beneath them and
Cambrai rose like a star.  The noise of the artillery
discharges came nearer.  It took on the heavy,
booming tones of a March sea beating hollowly on
cliffs.
</p>

<p>
"We're coming near the firing-line," Meriwell said
to himself.  "We ought to be rising now."
</p>

<p>
He glanced across to where the steersman stood
cowled and rigid at his wheel, his slim, tall form
suggested more than defined by the hooded electric
lights.  Beside him poring over compass and map,
his pale lawyer's face showing up like that of a
hunting-bird, was the navigating lieutenant.  In the
shadows, leaning over the edge of the car, as a
captain leans over his flying bridge, was the flight
commander, old Colonel Sanderson.  Meriwell glanced
surreptitiously at his square-cut, tow-like beard and
bowed engineer's shoulders.  They seemed to droop
more than ever to-night.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old skipper!" Meriwell muttered sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
The guns of the firing-line crashed into the air
with heavy, shattering blasts.  In the distance there
showed the faint shadows of lights.  Green shadows,
that were lyddite; and infinitesimal pin-points of
yellow, that were the flashes of rifles; and the pretty
orange of shrapnel; and the blinding white of
magnesium flares.
</p>

<p>
"Eighteen degrees up," the navigating lieutenant
ordered.  He watched his plumb-line while the
steersman heaved on his switch.  "Easy!  Steady!
Right-o!"
</p>

<p>
The floor of the car tilted like the deck of a steamer
rising to the swell.  The huge dirigible nosed her
way upward like a mounting dragon-fly.  They
passed through a fleece of cloud that touched them
caressingly like soft fingers.  The noise of battle
beneath them faded into a vibrating bass chord.  The
propellers purred like giant cats.
</p>

<p>
"She answered like a blood mare," said the
navigator, pride ringing in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"If only my guns and bombs go as well as your
planes," Meriwell told him, "I'll be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
"They will, never fear," the navigator laughed.
</p>

<p>
They were all proud of her, navigator, gunnery
lieutenant, engineers, and crew.  Full-fledged, like
Minerva from the head of Jove, she had appeared
from the tousled brain of the queer, misshapen
Scotch engineer of the Clyde, who had come knocking
at the door of the war-office when the slug-shaped
Zeppelins were pouring fire on the heart of London
and the British airmen were relying on frail,
insufficient biplanes&mdash;sparrow-hawks competing with
eagles.  They had, thank God! trusted that little man
with the Scots accent and the brier pipe, and here
they had her now in the air, three hundred feet of her,
a miracle of aluminum and gas and oiled silk, rigid,
dependable, fleet as a bullet from a sharpshooter's
piece.  Meriwell studied her lines through the darkness
with a throb of pride: her graceful length, like
some wonderful night insect; the wide sweep of her
planes, like a jinn's wings, the shelf-like horizontal
ones to send her nosing upward like a hawk or to let
her down in a gliding sea-gull's swoop, the vertical
one like the rudder of a gigantic vessel; the three
great baskets, attached to the keel with the trellised
runway between them; the four propellers, humming
like a nest of bees, two to the forward car, two to the
aft; the platform above the many-jointed aluminum-covered
balloons, with its emergency bridge and
rapid-fire gun.
</p>

<p>
"We're up seven thousand feet," the navigating
lieutenant grinned.  "How do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't like it at all," Meriwell answered.  His
teeth were chattering.
</p>

<p>
"You'll like it less in a minute.  I'm going up to
ten."
</p>

<p>
The din of fighting below had vanished into a
faint murmur and the flashing guns and flaming
artillery had become small, flickering lights, like
fireflies on an August night.  Occasionally a cloud flicked
past below them and shut off even the pinpoints of
light.  Here and there a group of stars showed, coldly
lustrous, while southward toward Reims one fell
sheer, like a bomb.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather be shot than as cold as this," Meriwell
grumbled.  Beneath his leather suit and woolen
mask his skin had become rough as sandpaper.
</p>

<p>
He looked about the car.  The navigator stamped
his feet and swung his arms with the cold.  The
steersman crouched low behind the wheel.  Four of
the crew huddled in blankets against the walls of
the basket.  Only the commander stood imperturbable
and grim, looking into the night.  The shaded
electric bulbs threw a sickly yellow light over the
mechanism of the dirigible; over the black signal-board,
on which green, red, and white circles and
triangles showed, messages to and from the engineers
fore and aft; over the row of switches, like those in
a railroad tower, that opened the cages beneath the
cars to release the pear-shaped bombs; over the
navigator's map and compass.  They outlined dimly
the machine gun that peered over each side swathed
in their oilskin coverings.  They drew strange, green
glints from barometer and spirit-level, and made
silver sparkles on the frost crystals that were
forming, parallelogram on parallelogram and triangle
on triangle, among the twisted riggings of the
car.
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?" Meriwell asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's ten-thirty," the navigator jerked.  "We'll
make Mainz by two and be back about dawn."
</p>

<p>
The cold became more dry and piercing.  It
seemed to ooze in at the pores and mingle with the
blood and compose itself into a mixture that chilled
flesh and bone.  Meriwell felt his limbs going numb.
The countryside beneath was becoming darker.
There were no longer great chandeliers of light to
show towns and small clusters that were villages.
To the left a faint geometrical array of arc lamps
rose dimly.  The navigator crossed to the side of
the car and looked at it for a moment.  He shook his
head grimly.  Meriwell knew it was Brussels.  A
cloud enveloped them and dashed them with particles
of dew that were like a shower of frost.  Through
the thick spray the figures of the steersman and
commander loomed up gigantically, like visitors
from another world showing vaguely through a
misty dawn.
</p>

<p>
There was something eerie, Meriwell thought, in
the immobility of the commander.  He should have
shown more eagerness, more of a sense of satisfied
ambition.  For years the old engineer officer had
lived in the hope of seeing England recapture her
lead in the aviation of the world.  He had worked
night and day in his laboratory, testing gases, testing
metals, working out models for a battleship of the air
that would thrust aside the Zeppelin and the
Schutte-Laenze as the steamer put aside the barkentine.
And now to-night he was commanding his dream for
the first time in action.  He was to raid the great
railway network of Mainz, over which German corps
were entraining night and day for the last supreme
effort to gain the coast towns.  In two hours he would
be tearing the mighty terminal to shreds of twisted
rails and charred wood, and distorted lumps of iron
that had once been panting locomotives.  Meriwell
was proud to be with him, and the commander should
be proudest of all.  The gunner remembered how
the old man had pleaded for the detail.  The chief
of staff had argued he was too old; he was too
valuable.  The chief had had in mind a thing Meriwell
had forgotten and which suddenly came back to him
with stunning force.  But the old aviator had won.
</p>

<p>
"The old sportsman!" Meriwell said to himself,
and his throat choked with pride; "the great
old sportsman!"
</p>

<p>
He remembered how, on the first raid of the
leprous-white Zeppelins from over the channel, the
first house to be struck was the house of the old
commander, a square, uncompromising, soldier-like
house on Notting Hill, where his wife&mdash;the
gray-haired, motherly lady with the dignified
eyes&mdash;dwelt, and his widow daughter, mourning her
husband dead somewhere in France.  His soldier
son, of the Sherwood Foresters, home on leave, was
sleeping at the time.  There were heard the high
whir of propellers and the desultory crashing of
anti-aircraft guns.  Then, accurate as a
thunderbolt, the great pear-shaped bomb had dropped,
with the crash of lightning striking a tree.  A
colleague of the Royal Artillery, a blunt old fighter,
with a cropped gray moustache, had told him about
it, tactfully, laconically, with a fighter's sympathy.
He told him how the gray-haired lady had died&mdash;very
dignified, as she had been in life; very peaceful,
as befitted an upright gentlewoman, her calm features
mercifully unmarked.  He stumbled as he spoke
of the young captain, for a soldier should die on the
battlefield, with guns roaring and his men about
him, instead of being potted like a rat in a
corn-stack.  When he came to the daughter his face
diffused to purple and his gray eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
"Curse them!" he swore viciously, "curse them
night, noon, and morning! living and dead! the
rotten gallows-birds!"
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Carter," the aviator had said.
"Thank you for telling me."  And he had walked
off, fumbling pitifully at his sword-belt.  What
black hairs he had left had turned white since then,
and his gray eyes were more sunken, but his beard
jutted savagely since, and his voice snapped
commands to his airmen with a ring like that of
steel.
</p>

<p>
"I wish we were over that railway station," said
Meriwell to himself, grimly.  He squinted across
at the switches of the bomb-cages and at the silent
machine guns in their oilskin swathings.  "He's
going to get some good work in to-night, if I can
help."
</p>

<p>
The officer at the compass straightened suddenly.
He punched at the indicator buttons in a quick
burst of energy.
</p>

<p>
"Up planes," he shouted.  "Nine degrees down."
</p>

<p>
"Nine down!" the steersman repeated.  He
heaved on his switch with a long, graceful pull.
The notches clicked successively like a clock in
winding.  The car tilted forward gradually.  Meriwell
grasped at a support to keep himself from sliding.
Wind flew against them in a strong upward sweep.
The steersman braced to his wheel like a wrestler.
The propellers purred less loudly.  Meriwell had
the sensation of being gently pulled downward.
He looked over the side of the car fearfully.  A few
desultory lights showed dimly, like the lamps of a
train in the distance.  An engineer officer dropped
into the car from the passage, electric torch in one
hand and oil-can in the other.  He reeked
pungently of gasolene.
</p>

<p>
"Time you were going down," he remarked
peevishly to the navigating lieutenant in strong
Scots.  "Do you want all my engines to freeze?"
</p>

<p>
"It'll be hot enough pretty soon," the navigator
jeered at him.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we?" Meriwell asked.
</p>

<p>
"South of Maastricht," the lieutenant answered.
He was as excited as a schoolboy.  "We'll be over
the border in a minute."  He leaned toward the
wind-gauge.  "Doing seventy-two miles an hour,"
he shouted after the engineer.
</p>

<p>
It was warmer now.  Meriwell glanced at the
scale beside the barometer and saw it registered
two thousand five hundred feet.  Vague, clean
scents stole through the wind&mdash;the white odour of
hawthorn and the freshness of spring grass and
early flowers, and the transparent odour of the
wind, like the transparent taste of water.  Sounds
rose vaguely into the air&mdash;the shadows of sounds,
it seemed&mdash;the baying of an uneasy dog and the
twitter of startled birds.  An automobile-horn
screamed raucously and somewhere there was the
cutting whistle of a train.  As he leaned over the
side of the car, the gunnery lieutenant saw the
sparsely lighted land slip away beneath them as a
pier slips away from a liner.  Occasionally there
was a brightly lighted municipal building; occasionally
a microscopic point that Meriwell felt was a
man with a lantern.  Here and there a forge licked
like flames on a volcano&mdash;a mute suggestion of
war in which labour ceased neither night nor day.
Afar off a flashing line of lights, like the lighted
fuse of a crude mine, showed a train speeding.
Meriwell felt himself looking at these things as a
disembodied spirit might&mdash;the last odour and
sound and sight of an earth that years of dwelling in
had invested with a great affection.  He felt himself
shiver.
</p>

<p>
He moved slightly against the edge of the car,
and as he did he discovered, with a sense of shock,
that his hand had grasped the rail so tightly that he
could hardly move it.  The horrible intent nervousness
that airmen know was lapping itself about him.
He felt a wild desire to find himself on earth again,
so wild that he had to clinch his teeth to prevent
himself from jumping over the side of the car.  He
was suddenly conscious of his nerves&mdash;they seemed
to spread all over his body like the veins of an ivy
leaf, to be writhing, to be crying at his finger-tips.
A great fear came on him, as it might come on a man
swimming in the ocean far from sight of land or
sail.  They had no right to be there, he said to
himself fiercely, no right to be high among the
winds.  They were intruders, impertinently
encroaching on the domain of some Power whose
inalienable domain the air was.  They might irritate
It, who had placed them on the earth to walk with
feet on it and not above it to fly with wings.  At
any moment It might arise and smite their meagre
human device of gas and steel as a man might
smash a fly on the wall.  He cowered suddenly, as
if expecting a blow.
</p>

<p>
A faint exhalation of pale light showed to the
northeast like a phosphorescent cloud&mdash;Aix-la-Chapelle!
So they were over the border at last!
Meriwell's teeth set and his eyes glinted.  A sense
of danger seized him, and suddenly there began
running in his head the full sonorous rhythm of the
"Watch upon the Rhine."  They were over the
iron wall at last, over the impregnable ring of steel.
In spite of singing, in spite of all boasting&mdash;and as
he felt his blood pulse proudly another chilling
terror came over him.  He felt as if the souls of all
the dead fighters of the empire were rising up against
them in a vast current of wings, Saxon men and
Prussian and Hessian, soldiers of Bavaria and of
Würtemberg, levies of the Hansa towns&mdash;striking
at the steel bird with ineffectual, spiritual fingers,
clinging pathetically to rigging and nacelle and
plane, gazing hatefully at the invaders with horrible
bloodshot, unbodily eyes....
</p>

<p>
The navigator turned suddenly to the man at
the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce is wrong with you?" he raged.
"Starboard, I said.  Starboard!"
</p>

<p>
The steersman bent to the wheel.  He tugged
and pushed until the veins stood out on his forehead
like ropes.
</p>

<p>
"Can't do anything, sir," he stammered, "I'm
jammed."
</p>

<p>
The navigator jumped to the signal-board.  He
snapped switches like fingers cracking.  He leaned
into the shelter-box of the speaking-tube.
</p>

<p>
"Cut off," he shouted, "the rudder's jammed.
Engineer-lieutenant amidships!"
</p>

<p>
The hum of the propellers died away musically.
The dirigible glided easily like a bird volplaning.
There was the shuffle of feet along the metal-latticed
passage.  The dour Scots lieutenant dropped into
the car, cotton waste in one hand and oil-can in the
other.  His second, a bright-cheeked Suffolk lad,
leaped agilely after him.
</p>

<p>
"Oil on the hinges all evaporated&mdash;with your
seventy-two miles an hour," the lieutenant snapped
at the navigator.  "I'll go aft and oil up."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do that," the second urged.  He caught at
the oil-can and plucked his torch from its scabbard.
They heard him patter aft in the rear car.  They
saw his light flicker for an instant as he swung into
the rigging.  The Scotsman looked after him with an
affectionate eye.
</p>

<p>
"A fine lad!" he murmured, "and a fine nerve
he has!"
</p>

<p>
As he looked over the rail of the nacelle Meriwell
saw the earth swing beneath him gently like a cradle
rocking.  The swaying lights gave him a sense of
dizziness.  He felt suddenly that the earth was a
small thing, bowling through space like a tossed ball.
</p>

<p>
"Right!" he heard the engineer's second hail faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Right-o!" came the cheery call of the navigator.
He watched the light of the boy's torch as he crept
along the rigging to the main car.  He heard him
bandy a hearty word with somebody.  He heard a
gruff word of caution, a laugh, and a choked scream.
Meriwell sprang to his full height and grasped the
rail with both hands.  He saw the flicker of the
shadow as it plunged downward.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" he blurted.  "He's gone!"
</p>

<p>
The navigator rushed to the side of the car like a
maniac.  The steersman half-turned from the wheel.
The engineer officer stiffened like a pointing dog.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone!" the navigator said stupidly.  "Poor
Conroy's gone!"
</p>

<p>
They stood a moment silent, looking at each other
in white horror.  The commander came out of the
shadows.  He took his peaked cap off.
</p>

<p>
"God be good to a gallant officer!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Amen!" Meriwell answered.
</p>

<p>
The engineer strode forward silently through the
passage.  The commander touched the navigating
officer on the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Ahead, Mr. Brennan," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
The navigator caught up his tube.
</p>

<p>
"Full ahead," he ordered.  He turned to the
steersman.  "Southeast by east," he directed.
</p>

<p>
"Southeast by east," the steersman repeated
mechanically.  The propellers throbbed, whirred,
hummed.  The night air cut against them like a
whip.  A lone star showed up for a moment in a break
of cloud, and then disappeared again, as a stage
disappears between closing curtains.
</p>

<p>
Meriwell felt dazed.  War&mdash;this wasn't war!  This
was a puny fooling with the engines of destiny,
children pulling the triggers of firearms.  He remembered
how a great-uncle of his had died at Balaklava:
a bright morning with the battle-drums beating;
guns pealing, soldiers cheering; Cardigan riding
gallantly at the head of the Light Brigade.  <i>Pro
patria mori</i>!  Yes&mdash;but to fall two thousand feet in
the night-time and to strike an alien ground with a
sickening thud&mdash;that was not war.  That was horror.
He remembered inconsequently how he had heard
that a man would be dead before he struck the
ground and the thought consoled him somewhat.
</p>

<p>
Stollberg slipped past dreamily in a murk,
Lamersdorf, Blankenheim, Adenau and Honnigen.  Carts
rattled as they flashed over Dumpelfeld.  At Naub
an alert sentry fired his Mauser, a whip's crack and
a bullet's futile ping.  Coblenz flitted past and they
were over the Rhine, black, undulating, reflecting
mistily the lamps of unsleeping barges.  They swung
over Wiesbaden, and Mainz came toward them,
ambling like a man into ambush.  The dirigible
tilted upward at an angle of thirty.  Meriwell
sprang to the centre of the car.  The commander
climbed forward.
</p>

<p>
"Remember," he warned.  "Not a second to waste!"
</p>

<p>
Doubt and nervousness dropped from Meriwell
like a cloak.  His brain sprang into action like a
boxer's muscles at the call of the gong.  He clambered
forward along the passage toward the first arc.
Already the gun crew had stripped the covers from
the machine guns.  Men stood alongside the rails
with queer umbrella-like things in their hands&mdash;the
asbestos parachutes, with their naphtha-soaked
torch in the handle, flares that would light up every
cranny in the ground beneath and protect the
dirigible from the light of the flares themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Ready, gunner?" asked the navigating lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"Ready," Meriwell sang back.
</p>

<p>
They swung toward the town easily as a ship comes
to its pier.  Beneath them they could see the lights
of the railroad station, big violet globes that radiated
like stars.  Men hurried to and fro along the concrete
platforms&mdash;queer, squat, huddled figures.  Two
engines fussed in and out like busy housewives.  In
one corner was a massed city of railroad-cars.  Rails
shone in a bewildering intricacy like a metal puzzle.
Long, lank sheds showed like barns.
</p>

<p>
"Ease up," the commander ordered.  He stood
square in the centre of the car, his beard jutting, his
hands thrust deep in his pockets.  It was as if some
main nerve had suddenly come into play, electrifying
the great steel vessel.  The navigator sprang to the
speaking-tube.
</p>

<p>
"Cut off," he shouted.  He thrust the steersman
away from the wheel and caught at the spokes.
"Figure of eight," he muttered.  The dirigible swung
gracefully in a curve leftward.  Meriwell looked over
the side again and raised his night-glasses.  On the
platforms beneath men were running to and fro
excitedly.  As they looked upward they had the
appearance of a child's tin soldiers gazing fearsomely
at a human being.  A whistle cut metallically into
the air.  A carbine cracked.  A searchlight shot
skyward in a broad ribbon of white and began
casting about like a fisherman's line.  Somewhere there
was a thudding boom, a whining scream, and a
white star opened like a flower three hundred yards
away with a crash like wood breaking.
</p>

<p>
"Go ahead, Mr. Meriwell," the commander directed.
</p>

<p>
Meriwell raised his megaphone to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Overboard, the parachutes," he thundered.
</p>

<p>
There was a burst of murky, yellow flame fore and
aft.  Six flaming torches floated downward like
snowflakes falling.  The town cowered darkly to the rear
of them.  Beneath, to the right, the station showed
as if lit up by some great conflagration.  Above,
everything seemed to have gone grotesquely black.
Meriwell could hardly see across the car.  Another
searchlight leaped in to the air and crossed the first
one.  They stabbed about like the tentacles of an
octopus.  The anti-aircraft guns shot six white stars
to port in rapid succession like revolver shots.  Along
the concrete platforms a brace of sharpshooters
dropped to their knees and cuddled their pieces to
their cheeks.  The dirigible moved with easy dignity
toward the station.  Meriwell calculated a moment.
The bombs in the fall would carry forward in the
direction the dirigible was headed for.  He would
have to wait a moment.  Weights, distance, heights,
flashed through his head like the dots and dashes of
a Morse code.
</p>

<p>
"Sections A and B, lanyards 3 and 4, fore and
aft," he bellowed.  "Heave on!"
</p>

<p>
The dirigible shivered and jumped like a restive
horse as the gunners heaved on their switches and
the weighted bombs dropped from their cages.  A
searchlight caught the great hawk for a moment and
showed it gray and lustrous like a battleship at sea.
The navigator swung his wheel about with a jerk.
The dirigible turned like a hare.  The propellers
burst into a wild, spasmodic hum.  They oscillated
dangerously.  Meriwell clung onto the side and
looked over.
</p>

<p>
Eight great splotches of red flame burst suddenly
on the ground, sideways, like water splashing.  They
showed red and angry like a man's wound.  There
were dark streaks among them&mdash;earth thrown up,
men, metal, concrete.  A puff of hot wind struck
the car, and a vast unspeakable noise, a maddened,
crashing roar, like the earth protesting at being
attacked&mdash;a shuddering, horrible thing that drowned
the feeble crackling of the guns and seemed to blot
out life itself for a moment.  The dirigible shivered
like a feather in a gully of wind.
</p>

<p>
"Ease up," he called to the navigator.  "A and B,
lanyards 2 and 5, fore and aft," he roared again.
Again the jump and curvet of the car; the red
cup-like explosions, the terror of sound.  A gun boomed
southward, and something passed them with a high
shriek.  The searchlight caught them again and
hung on with the tenacity of a bulldog.  Something
like a fly appeared in the west.
</p>

<p>
"Look out," the commander warned the lieutenant
at the wheel.  "Get ready to rise."
</p>

<p>
Meriwell looked downward again with his glasses.
The naphtha planes were approaching the junction
on their drop and were lighting up the scene with a
lurid Satanic glow.  The glasses nearly slipped from
his hands.  Beneath him was chaos.  The glittering
rails, the compact platforms, the lank sheds, the
massed cars, the violet lights were no longer there.
The terminal showed like a ploughed field&mdash;a wilderness
of stone and earth, of twisted metal and shattered
wood.  Great chasms showed where the bombs
had struck; little hillocks of thrown-up earth; great
iron pillars broken in two like match-wood; huddled
figures that had been soldiers on the platform; while
from the massed cars and the long sheds great waves
of red and blackish flame showed with foam tops of
rolling brown smoke, rolling, licking, crackling,
roaring, like a mediæval dream of hell.
</p>

<p>
"I don't need section C," he laughed.  All the
havoc had been wrought by the light bombs.  There
were still eight mammoth pears in their cages,
unused.  He could save those.
</p>

<p>
"Get the bridge now, Mr. Meriwell," the
commander instructed, "and swing around to the
forts."
</p>

<p>
"Empty ballast," roared the navigator.
</p>

<p>
There was a gurgle as the stop-cocks on the
water-tanks of the keel were opened&mdash;a hollow rushing
that should have ended in a splash.  In the glaring
light the water poured downward in two great
streams fore and aft like silver cables falling.  The
dirigible rose as if drawn upward.  Bombs burst like
firecrackers.  Beneath, the fire rustled like crushed
paper and exploded now and then, in queer, hollow,
inadequate sounds.  The navigator swung over the
river.  Four thousand feet below, the bridge showed
over the black ribbon of the Rhine like a plank over
a rivulet.  Meriwell watched it with the eye of a cat
ready to spring on a mouse.
</p>

<p>
"Ready on section C," he warned, "lanyards 2
and 3, fore and aft."
</p>

<p>
They floated along hazily, like a stick along a
river.  The anti-aircraft guns broke into a passion
of whipping reports.  The searchlights cut into the
air like thrusting bayonets.
</p>

<p>
"Heave on!" he yelled suddenly.
</p>

<p>
The dirigible lifted violently like a canoe struck
by a great wave.  There was a loud whirring in the
air as the bombs dropped downward.  Meriwell felt
his heart jump to his mouth.  He peered over the
edge breathlessly, his hands gripping the rail with
sudden fear.  Mechanically he opened his mouth to
protect his ear-drums from the report, and as he
did a vast wave of orange flame, like discoloured
sheet lightning, seemed to flick along the river.  For
a moment, soundless, the river rose in its bed as if
struck by a mighty hand.  The great stone bridge
disappeared as if kicked away.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said Meriwell hoarsely, "my God!"
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly noise struck him between the
shoulder-blades, noise such as he could hardly
believe possible&mdash;an infinitude of sound that rocked
him like a crashing blow, a sound as of two planets
meeting in mid-course, a gigantic forbidden thing,
that only gods should make.
</p>

<p>
"The bridge is gone," said Meriwell stupidly.
</p>

<p>
A great hush swung over the town.  The anti-aircraft
guns stuttered and died.  The futile rifle fire
stopped.  The thunder of the forts was cut off in
mid-air.  Only the blaze at the junction roared a
little like a forced draft.  Over the river all was
black.  The water had shut off the flare of the
explosion.  The searchlight struck the ballonet of the
dirigible as a spear strikes a fish.  There was the
throb of propellers.
</p>

<p>
"Triplane to starboard," the navigator warned.
</p>

<p>
"Send him down, Mr. Meriwell," the commander
ordered calmly.  "Navigator, put the men by the
engines ready to start on the word."
</p>

<p>
The triplane rose jerkily in the air like a toy at
the end of a string.  Its three shelf-like planes
showed dimly and vaguely like a great kite.
Meriwell felt sorry for it&mdash;it was a game, chivalrous
thing, to rise in the air to give battle to the
leviathan.  He felt a great throb of sympathy and
sorrow for it.  It looked such a puny thing&mdash;but he
mustn't let it get above him, or alongside him&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Searchlight on starboard gun," he snapped.
</p>

<p>
A sergeant and corporal sprang to the Maxim.
They clamped a thing like an automobile-lamp to
the barrel.  They snapped a switch, and a line of
light shot out like a harpoon.  It whipped about
like a fencer's blade, parrying, thrusting, lifting,
dropping.  The corporal threw his leg over the
saddle and caught the trigger.
</p>

<p>
"When you see her, fire!" Meriwell ordered.
</p>

<p>
She showed up for a moment, black and fragile,
and motionless it seemed.  The gun broke into an
infuriated chatter.  The cartridge-tape leaped like
a hooked eel.  Suddenly they saw the great kite
twist like a wounded bird.  It dropped in a wavering
zigzag while two black pin-points dropped in
plumb-lines.
</p>

<p>
"God help them!" Meriwell breathed.
</p>

<p>
The propellers of the dirigible plunged into their
loud whir like the first peal of an organ.  Meriwell
staggered and lurched.  The dirigible shot forward
like a stone from a sling.  The commander fell to
pacing the car nervously.  His fingers cracked like
castanets.  His beard twitched.  He turned on the
gunner.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the forts," he shouted.  "We've
done enough.  What have you left?"
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen small and four large bombs," Meriwell
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Get ready," he warned.  He turned to the
navigator.  "Back and over the town."
</p>

<p>
"Back and over the town?" the navigator
queried stupidly.  "Over the town?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the commander barked.  His face seemed
queerly white and strained.  "Let them have all
you've got, Mr. Meriwell."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean&mdash;?"  Meriwell nearly laughed
in amazement.  "Bombard the town?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Quick.  Circle around and let go."
</p>

<p>
A great, tawny lake of flame poured over the
acreage of cars in the junction.  It lighted the town
dully and they could see it hazily, through a smoke
screen, as it were.  The narrow Gothic buildings
showed up as in a painting; the peaceful cathedral;
the great, squat municipal hall; the queer dolls'
houses&mdash;it all seemed like a theatrical spectacle.
Southward the gunners still threw their white stars
and the artillery of the forts stabbed red and
blindly into the murky fog.
</p>

<p>
"Take the wheel," the navigator told the steersman.
"Planes up eighteen and swing in a circle."
He looked at the commander with grave, disquieted
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Meriwell caught at the commander's sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"My God, sir!  You can't do that!" he shouted
in horror.  "You can't fire on civilians."
</p>

<p>
"I can," said the old man doggedly.  "I can and
I will."
</p>

<p>
"You're mad, sir!  You're mad!" he babbled.
</p>

<p>
A stray shot cut screaming past them.  They
rocked from the current.  The crew moved about
the car uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"Bring her around," the commander ordered.
The navigator never moved.
</p>

<p>
A vast desire to throw himself on the old
commander came on Meriwell, to bind him hand and
foot.  He must have gone crazy, he judged.  That
last terrific explosion had injured his brain.  Then
suddenly he remembered the house on Notting Hill,
the white-haired lady who had died on the night
raid, the screaming, distraught daughter, the
gallant captain of Sherwood Foresters killed like a rat
in a trap.  He understood.
</p>

<p>
"I can't do it, sir," the navigator replied.
Meriwell took a step toward him.  His hands
went out pleadingly.
</p>

<p>
"I know, sir.  I understand.  But we can't do it.
I won't give the order and the men wouldn't pull
the lanyards," his voice stumbled.  "We're soldiers,"
he continued, "and we're fighting soldiers&mdash;not
unarmed men, not sleeping children, not women."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence.  The wind blew
about them as from a great blast-pipe.  The reports
of the air-guns ceased for a moment and began
intermittently.  The navigator turned his head away.
Meriwell looked at the commander's white face.
</p>

<p>
"Soldiers!" he repeated.  "Clean fighters.
Soldiers and gentlemen.  Officers and gentlemen, as
your son was.  And your wife was a soldier's wife
and your daughter was a soldier's daughter."
</p>

<p>
He waved his hand toward the town.
</p>

<p>
"We've smashed the junction and smashed the
bridge.  No train will pass that way again and no
ship will come up the Rhine.  We've done our
work&mdash;and not a building outside injured and not a
civilian attacked.  They'd be proud of that, your people,
sir.  You can't do this other thing, sir.  It isn't
the game.  It isn't cricket."
</p>

<p>
He watched the commander's face keenly.  He
waited until he saw the bitter twist pass from the
mouth and the frown go out of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't want that," he urged.  "They'd
be ashamed, those people of yours."  He waited a
moment.  "The old code, sir, an officer and a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
The commander's head drooped a little.  The stiff
poise of his grey beard softened.  His shoulders lost
their tenseness suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;" he wavered.  He turned to the navigator.
"Right about and back," he said weakly.
He slipped into the rear among the shadows.
</p>

<p>
The navigator sprang to his compass.
</p>

<p>
"Nor'west by west," he ordered.
</p>

<p>
"Nor'west by west," the steersman repeated mechanically.
</p>

<p>
And as Meriwell leaned over the car he saw the
town race flatly away from them, while the guns
still chattered viciously, like disturbed magpies, and
their charges burst high in the air into pretty,
artificial stars.

THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER OF ASPINWALL*
</h3>

<p>
On a time it happened that the lighthouse
keeper in Aspinwall, not far from Panama,
disappeared without a trace.  Since he
disappeared during a storm, it was supposed that
the ill-fated man went to the very edge of the small,
rocky island on which the lighthouse stood, and
was swept out by a wave.  This supposition seemed
the more likely as his boat was not found next day
in its rocky niche.  The place of lighthouse keeper
had become vacant.  It was necessary to fill this
place at the earliest moment possible, since the
lighthouse had no small significance for the local
movement as well as for vessels going from New
York to Panama.  Mosquito Bay abounds in
sandbars and banks.  Among these navigation,
even in the daytime, is difficult; but at night,
especially with the fogs which are so frequent on those
waters warmed by the sun of the tropics, it is nearly
impossible.  The only guide at that time for the
numerous vessels is the lighthouse.
</p>

<p>
The task of finding a new keeper fell to the United
States consul living in Panama, and this task was
no small one: first, because it was absolutely
necessary to find the man within twelve hours; second,
the man must be unusually conscientious,&mdash;it was
not possible, of course, to take the first comer at
random; finally, there was an utter lack of
candidates.  Life on a tower is uncommonly difficult,
and by no means enticing to people of the South,
who love idleness and the freedom of a vagrant life.
That lighthouse keeper is almost a prisoner.  He
cannot leave his rocky island except on Sundays.
A boat from Aspinwall brings him provisions and
water once a day, and returns immediately; on the
whole island, one acre in area, there is no inhabitant.
The keeper lives in the lighthouse; he keeps it in
order.  During the day he gives signals by displaying
flags of various colours to indicate changes of
the barometer; in the evening he lights the lantern.
This would be no great labour were it not that to
reach the lantern at the summit of the tower he
must pass over more than four hundred steep and
very high steps; sometimes he must make this
journey repeatedly during the day.  In general,
it is the life of monk, and indeed more than that,&mdash;the
life of a hermit.  It was not wonderful, therefore,
that Mr. Isaac Falconbridge was in no small
anxiety as to where he should find a permanent
successor to the recent keeper; and it is easy to
understand his joy when a successor announced
himself most unexpectedly on that very day.  He
was a man already old, seventy years or more, but
fresh, erect, with the movements and bearing of a
soldier.  His hair was perfectly white, his face as
dark as that of a Creole; but, judging from his blue
eyes, he did not belong to a people of the South.
His face was somewhat downcast and sad, but
honest.  At the first glance he pleased Falconbridge.
It remained only to examine him.  Therefore
the following conversation began:
</p>

<p>
"Where are you from?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a Pole."
</p>

<p>
"Where have you worked up to this time?"
</p>

<p>
"In one place and another."
</p>

<p>
"A lighthouse keeper should like to stay in one
place."
</p>

<p>
"I need rest."
</p>

<p>
"Have you served?  Have you testimonials of
honourable government service?"
</p>

<p>
The old man drew from his bosom a piece of
faded silk resembling a strip of an old flag,
unwound it, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Here are the testimonials.  I received this
cross in 1830.  This second one is Spanish from the
Carlist War; the third is the French legion; the
fourth I received in Hungary.  Afterward I fought
in the States against the South; there they do not
give crosses."
</p>

<p>
Falconbridge took the paper and began to read.
</p>

<p>
"H'm!  Skavinski?  Is that your name?  H'm!
Two flags captured in a bayonet attack.  You were
a gallant soldier."
</p>

<p>
"I am able to be a conscientious lighthouse
keeper."
</p>

<p>
"It is necessary to ascend the tower a number of
times daily.  Have you sound legs?"
</p>

<p>
"I crossed the plains on foot."  (The immense
steppes between the East and California are called
"the plains.")
</p>

<p>
"Do you know sea service?"
</p>

<p>
"I served three years on a whaler."
</p>

<p>
"You have tried various occupations."
</p>

<p>
"The only one I have not known is quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Why is that?"
</p>

<p>
The old man shrugged his shoulders.  "Such is
my fate."
</p>

<p>
"Still you seem to me too old for a lighthouse
keeper."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," exclaimed the candidate suddenly in a
voice of emotion, "I am greatly wearied, knocked
about.  I have passed through much as you see.
This place is one of those which I have wished for
most ardently.  I am old, I need rest.  I need to
say to myself, 'Here you will remain; this is your
port.'  Ah, sir, this depends now on you alone.
Another time perhaps such a place will not offer
itself.  What luck that I was in Panama!  I
entreat you&mdash;as God is dear to me, I am like a ship
which if it misses the harbour will be lost.  If you
wish to make an old man happy&mdash;I swear to
you that I am honest, but&mdash;I have enough of
wandering."
</p>

<p>
The blue eyes of the old man expressed such
earnest entreaty that Falconbridge, who had a
good, simple heart, was touched.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, "I'll take you.  You are a
lighthouse keeper."
</p>

<p>
The old man's face gleamed with inexpressible joy.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Can you go to the tower to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"I can."
</p>

<p>
"Then good-bye.  Another word,&mdash;for any failure
in service you will be dismissed."
</p>

<p>
"All right."
</p>

<p>
That same evening, when the sun had descended
on the other side of the isthmus, and a day of
sunshine was followed by a night without twilight, the
new keeper was in his place evidently, for the
lighthouse was casting its bright rays on the water as
usual.  The night was perfectly calm, silent, genuinely
tropical, filled with a transparent haze, forming
around the moon a great coloured rainbow with
soft, unbroken edges; the sea was moving only
because the tide raised it.  Skavinski on the balcony
seemed from below like a small black point.  He
tried to collect his thoughts and take in his new
position; but his mind was too much under pressure
to move with regularity.  He felt somewhat as a
hunted beast feels when at last it has found refuge
from pursuit on some inaccessible rock or in a cave.
There had come to him, finally, an hour of quiet;
the feeling of safety filled his soul with a certain
unspeakable bliss.  Now on that rock he can simply
laugh at his previous wanderings, his misfortunes,
and failures.  He was in truth like a ship whose
masts, ropes, and sails had been broken and rent
by a tempest, and cast from the clouds to the bottom
of the sea,&mdash;a ship on which the tempest had hurled
waves and spat foam, but which still wound its
way to the harbour.  The pictures of that storm
passed quickly through his mind as he compared it
with the calm future now beginning.  A part of
his wonderful adventures he had related to
Falconbridge; he had not mentioned, however, thousands
of other incidents.  It had been his misfortune that
as often as he pitched his tent and fixed his fireplace
to settle down permanently, some wind tore out
the stakes of his tent, whirled away the fire, and
bore him on toward destruction.  Looking now
from the balcony of the tower at the illuminated
waves, he remembered everything through which
he had passed.  He had campaigned in the four
parts of the world, and in wandering had tried
almost every occupation.  Labour-loving and
honest, more than once had he earned money, and
had always lost it in spite of every prevision and the
utmost caution.  He had been a gold-miner in
Australia, a diamond-digger in Africa, a rifleman in
public service in the East Indies.  He established a
ranch in California,&mdash;the drought ruined him; he
tried trading with wild tribes in the interior of
Brazil,&mdash;his raft was wrecked on the Amazon; he
himself alone, weaponless, and nearly naked,
wandered in the forest for many weeks living on wild
fruits, exposed every moment to death from the
jaws of wild beasts.  He established a forge in
Helena, Arkansas, and that was burned in a great
fire which consumed the whole town.  Next he fell
into the hands of the Indians in the Rocky
Mountains, and only through a miracle was he saved by
Canadian trappers.  Then he served as a sailor on a
vessel running between Bahia and Bordeaux, and as
a harpooner on a whaling-ship; both vessels were
wrecked.  He had a cigar factory in Havana, and
was robbed by his partner while he himself was
lying sick with the vomito.  At last he came to
Aspinwall, and there was to be the end of his
failures,&mdash;for what could reach him on that rocky island?
Neither water nor fire nor men.  But from men
Skavinski had not suffered much; he had met good
men oftener than bad ones.
</p>

<p>
But it seemed to him that all the four elements
were persecuting him.  Those who knew him said
that he had no luck, and with that they explained
everything.  He himself became somewhat of a
monomaniac.  He believed that some mighty and
vengeful hand was pursuing him everywhere, on all
lands and waters.  He did not like, however, to
speak of this; only at times, when someone asked
him whose hand that could be, he pointed mysteriously
to the Polar Star, and said, "It comes from
that place."  In reality his failures were so
continuous that they were wonderful, and might easily
drive a nail into the head, especially of the man who
had experienced them.  But Skavinski had the
patience of an Indian, and that great calm power of
resistance which comes from the truth of heart.
In his time he had received in Hungary a number of
bayonet-thrusts because he would not grasp at a
stirrup which was shown as means of salvation to
him, and cry for quarter.  In like manner he did
not bend to misfortune.  He crept up against the
mountain as industriously as an ant.  Pushed down
a hundred times, he began his journey calmly for
the hundred and first time.  He was in his way a
most peculiar original.  This old soldier, tempered,
God knows in how many fires, hardened in suffering,
hammered and forged, had the heart of a child.
In the time of the epidemic in Cuba, the vomito
attacked him because he had given to the sick all
his quinine, of which he had a considerable supply,
and left not a grain to himself.
</p>

<p>
There had been in him also this wonderful
quality,&mdash;that after so many disappointments he was ever
full of confidence, and did not lose hope that all
would be well yet.  In winter he grew lively, and
predicted great events.  He waited for these events
with impatience, and lived with the thought of them
whole summers.  But the winters passed one after
another, and Skavinski lived only to this,&mdash;that
they whitened his head.  At last he grew old, began
to lose energy; his endurance was becoming more
and more like resignation, his former calmness was
tending toward supersensitiveness, and that
tempered soldier was degenerating into a man ready to
shed tears for any cause.  Besides this, from time to
time he was weighed down by a terrible homesickness
which was roused by any circumstance,&mdash;the
sight of swallows, gray birds like sparrows, snow on
the mountains or melancholy music like that heard
on a time.  Finally there was one idea which
mastered him,&mdash;the idea of rest.  It mastered the
old man thoroughly and swallowed all other desires
and hopes.  This ceaseless wanderer could not
imagine anything more to be longed for, anything
more precious than a quiet corner in which to rest
and wait in silence for the end.  Perhaps specially
because some whim of fate had so hurried him over
all seas and lands that he could hardly catch his
breath did he imagine that the highest human
happiness was simply not to wander.  It is true
that such modest happiness was his due; but he
was so accustomed to disappointments that he
thought of rest as people in general think of
something which is beyond reach.  He did not dare to
hope for it.  Meanwhile unexpectedly in the
course of twelve hours he had gained a position
which was as if chosen for him out of all the world.
We are not to wonder, then, that when he lighted
his lantern in the evening he became as it were
dazed,&mdash;that he asked himself if that was reality,
and he did not dare to answer that it was.  But
at the same time reality convinced him with
incontrovertible proofs; hence, hours one after
another passed while he was on the balcony.  He
gazed, and convinced himself.  It might seem that
he was looking at the sea for the first time in his
life.  The lens of the lantern cast into the darkness
an enormous triangle of light, beyond which the eye
of the old man was lost in the black distance
completely, in the distance mysterious and awful.  But
that distance seemed to run toward the light.  The
long waves following one another rolled out from
the darkness, and went bellowing toward the base
of the island; and then their foaming backs were
visible, shining rose-coloured in the light of the
lantern.  The incoming tide swelled more and more
and covered the sandy bars.  The mysterious
speech of the ocean came with a fulness more
powerful and louder, at one time like the thunder of
cannon, at another like the roar of great forests, at
another like the distant dull sound of the voices of
people.  At the moments it was quiet; then to the
ears of the old man came some great sigh, then a
kind of sobbing and again threatening outbursts.
At last the wind bore away the haze, but brought
black broken clouds, which hid the moon.  From
the west it began to blow more and more; the waves
sprang with rage against the rock of the lighthouse
licking with foam the foundation walls.  In the
distance a storm was beginning to bellow.  On the
dark, disturbed expanse certain green lanterns
gleamed from the masts of ships.  These green
points rose high and then sank; now they swayed
to the right, and now to the left.  Skavinski
descended to his room.  The storm began to howl.
Outside, people on those ships were struggling with
night, with darkness, with waves; but inside the
tower it was calm and still.  Even the sounds of
the storm hardly came through the thick walls, and
only the measured tick-tack of the clock lulled the
wearied old man to his slumber.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
Hours, days, and weeks began to pass.  Sailors
assert that sometimes when the sea is greatly roused,
something from out the midst of night and darkness
calls them by name.  If the infinity of the sea may
call out thus, perhaps when a man is growing old,
calls come to him, too, from another infinitely still
darker and more deeply mysterious; and the more
he is wearied by life the dearer are those calls to him.
But to hear them quiet is needed.  Besides old age
loves to put itself aside as if with a foreboding of the
grave.  The lighthouse had become for Skavinski
such a half grave.  Nothing is more monotonous
than life on a beacon-tower.  If young people consent
to take up this service they leave it after a time.
Lighthouse keepers are generally men not young,
gloomy, and confined to themselves.  If by chance
one of them leaves his lighthouse and goes among
men, he walks in the midst of them like a person
roused from deep slumber.  On the tower there is a
lack of minute impressions which in ordinary life
teach men to adapt themselves to everything.  All
that a lighthouse keeper comes in contact with is
gigantic, and devoid of definitely outlined forms.
The sky is one whole, the water another; and
between those two infinities the soul of man is in
loneliness.  That is a life in which thought is continual
meditation, and out of that meditation nothing
rouses the keeper, not even his work.  Day is like
day as two beads in a rosary, unless changes of
weather form the only variety.  But Skavinski felt
more happiness than ever in life before.  He rose
with the dawn, took his breakfast, polished the lens,
and then sitting on the balcony gazed into the
distance of the water; and his eyes were never sated
with the pictures which he saw before him.  On the
enormous turquoise ground of the ocean were to be
seen generally flocks of swollen sails gleaming in the
rays of the sun so brightly that the eyes were blinking
before the excess of light.  Sometimes the ships,
favoured by the so-called trade winds, went in an
extended line one after another, like a chain of
sea-mews or albatrosses.  The red casks indicating the
channel swayed on the light wave with gentle
movement.  Among the sails appeared every afternoon
gigantic grayish feather-like plumes of smoke.  That
was a steamer from New York which brought
passengers and goods to Aspinwall, drawing behind it
a frothy path of foam.  On the other side of the
balcony Skavinski saw, as if on his palm, Aspinwall
and its busy harbour, and in it a forest of masts,
boats and craft; a little farther, white houses and
the towers of the town.  From the height of his tower
the small houses were like the nests of sea-mews,
the boats were like beetles and the people moved
around like small points on the white boulevard.
From early morning a light eastern breeze brought
a confused hum of human life, above which
predominated the whistle of steamers.  In the
afternoon six o'clock came; the movement in the harbour
began to cease; the mews hid themselves in the rent
of the cliffs; the waves grew feeble and became in
some sort lazy; and then on the land, on the sea, and
on the tower came a time of stillness unbroken by
anything.  The yellow sands from which the waves
had fallen back glittered like golden stripes on the
width of the waters; the body of the tower was
outlined definitely in blue.  Floods of sunbeams were
poured from the sky on the water and the sands and
the cliff.  At that time a certain lassitude full of
sweetness seized the old man.  He felt that the
rest which he was enjoying was excellent; and when
he thought that it would be continuous nothing was
lacking to him.
</p>

<p>
Skavinski was intoxicated with his own happiness
and since a man adapts himself easily to improved
condition, he gained faith and confidence by degrees;
for he thought that if men built houses for invalids,
why should not God gather up at last His own
invalids?  Time passed, and confirmed him in this
conviction.  The old man grew accustomed to his
tower, to the lantern, to the rock, to the sand-bars,
to solitude.  He grew accustomed also to the
sea-mews which hatched in the crevices of the rock, and
in the evening held meetings on the roof of the
lighthouse.  Skavinski threw to them generally the
remnants of his food; and soon they grew tame, and
afterward, when he fed them, a real storm of white
wings encircled him, and the old man went among
the birds like a shepherd among sheep.  When the
tide ebbed he went to the low sand-banks, on which
he collected savory periwinkles and beautiful pearl
shells of the nautilus, which receding waves had left
on the sand.  In the night by the moonlight and the
tower he went to catch fish, which frequented the
windings of the cliff in myriads.  At last he was in
love with his rocks and his treeless little island, grown
over only with small thick plants exuding sticky
resin.  The distant views repaid him for the poverty
of the island, however.  During afternoon hours,
when the air became very clear he could see the
whole isthmus covered with the richest vegetation.
It seemed to Skavinski at such times that he saw
one gigantic garden,&mdash;bunches of cocoa, and enormous
musa, combined, as it were, in luxurious tufted
bouquets, right there behind the houses of Aspinwall.
Farther on, between Aspinwall and Panama, was a
great forest over which every morning and evening
hung a reddish haze of exhalations,&mdash;a real tropical
forest with its feet in stagnant water, interlaced with
lianas and filled with the sound of one sea of gigantic
orchids, palms, milk-trees, iron-trees, gum-trees.
</p>

<p>
Through his field-glass the old man could see not
only trees and the broad leaves of bananas, but even
legions of monkeys and great marabous and flocks
of parrots, rising at times like a rainbow cloud over
the forest.  Skavinski knew such forests well, for
after being wrecked on the Amazon he had wandered
whole weeks among similar arches and thickets.  He
had seen how many dangers and deaths lie concealed
under those wonderful and smiling exteriors.
During the nights which he had spent in them he
heard close at hand the sepulchral voices of howling
monkeys and the roaring of the jaguars; he saw
gigantic serpents coiled like lianas on trees; he knew
those slumbering forest lakes full of torpedo-fish
and swarming crocodiles; he knew under what a
yoke man lives in those unexplored wildernesses in
which are single leaves that exceed a man's size ten
times,&mdash;wildernesses swarming with blood-drinking
mosquitoes, tree-leeches, and gigantic poisonous
spiders.  He had experienced that forest life
himself, had witnessed it, had passed through it;
therefore it gave him the greater enjoyment to look from
his height and gaze on those <i>matos</i>, admire their
beauty, and be guarded from their treacherousness.
His tower preserved him from every evil.  He left
it only for a few hours on Sunday.  He put on then
his blue keeper's coat with silver buttons, and hung
his crosses on his breast.  His milk-white head was
raised with a certain pride when he heard at the door,
while entering the church, the Creoles say among
themselves, "We have an honourable lighthouse
keeper and not a heretic, though he is a Yankee."  But
he returned straightway after Mass to his island,
and returned happy, for he had still no faith in the
mainland.  On Sunday also he read the Spanish
newspaper which he bought in the town, or the <i>New
York Herald</i>, which he borrowed from Falconbridge;
and he sought in it European news eagerly.  The
poor old heart on that lighthouse tower, and in
another hemisphere, was beating yet for its birthplace.
At times, too, when the boat brought his daily
supplies and water to the island, he went down from the
tower to talk with Johnson, the guard.  But after
awhile he seemed to grow shy.  He ceased to go to
the town to read the papers and to go down to talk
politics with Johnson.  Whole weeks passed in this
way, so that no one saw him and he saw no one.  The
only signs that the old man was living were the
disappearance of the provisions left on shore, and the
light of the lantern kindled every evening with the
same regularity with which the sun rose in the
morning from the waters of those regions.  Evidently,
the old man had become indifferent to the world.
Homesickness was not the cause, but just this,&mdash;that
even homesickness had passed into resignation.
The whole world began now and ended for Skavinski
on his island.  He had grown accustomed to the thought
that he would not leave the tower till his death,
and he simply forgot that there was anything else
besides it.  Moreover, he had become a mystic; his
mild blue eyes began to stare like the eyes of a child,
and were as if fixed on something at a distance.  In
the presence of a surrounding uncommonly simple
and great, the old man was losing the feeling of
personality; he was ceasing to exist as an individual,
was becoming merged more and more in that which
inclosed him.  He did not understand anything
beyond his environment: he felt only unconsciously.
At last it seems to him that the heavens, the water,
his rock, the tower, the golden sand-banks and the
swollen sails, the sea-mews, the ebb and flow of the
tide&mdash;all form a mighty unity.  One enormous
mysterious soul; that he is sinking in that mystery and
feels that soul which lives and lulls itself.  He sinks
and is rocked, forgets himself; and in that narrowing
of his own individual existence, in that half-waking,
half-sleeping, he has discovered a rest so great that
it nearly resembles half-death.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
III
</p>

<p>
But the awakening came.
</p>

<p>
On a certain day, when the boat brought water and
a supply of provisions, Skavinski came down an
hour later from the tower, and saw that besides the
usual cargo there was an additional package.  On
the outside of this package were postage stamps of
the United States, and the address: "Skavinski,
Esq.," written on coarse canvas.
</p>

<p>
The old man, with aroused curiosity, cut the
canvas, and saw books; he took one in his hand, looked
at it, and put it back; thereupon his hands began to
tremble greatly.  He covered his eyes as if he did not
believe them; it seemed to him as if he were dreaming.
The book was Polish,&mdash;what did that mean?
Who could have sent the book?  Clearly, it did not
occur to him at the first moment that in the
beginning of his lighthouse career he had read in the
<i>Herald</i>, borrowed from the consul, of the formation
of a Polish society in New York, and had sent at
once to that society half his month's salary, for
which he had, moreover, no use on the tower.  The
Society had sent him the books with thanks.  The
books came in the natural way; but at the first
moment the old man could not seize those thoughts.
Polish books in Aspinwall, on his tower, amid his
solitude,&mdash;that was for him something uncommon,
a certain breath from the past times, a kind of
miracle.  Now it seemed to him, as to those sailors in
the night, that something was calling him by name
with a voice greatly beloved and nearly forgotten.
He sat for a while with closed eyes, and was almost
certain that, when he opened them, the dream would
be gone.
</p>

<p>
The package, cut open, lay before him, shone
upon clearly by the afternoon sun, and on it was an
open book.  When the old man stretched his hand
toward it again, he heard in the stillness the beating
of his own heart.  He looked; it was poetry.  On
the outside stood printed in great letters the title,
underneath the name of the author.  The name was
not strange to Skavinski; he saw that it belonged
to the great poet,[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>] whose productions he had read in
1830, in Paris.  Afterward, when campaigning in
Algiers and Spain, he had heard from his countrymen
of the growing fame of the great seer; but he was so
accustomed to the musket at that time that he took no
book in hand.  In 1849 he went to America, and in
the adventurous life which he led he hardly ever met
a Pole, and never a Polish book.  With the greater
eagerness, therefore, and with a livelier beating of
the heart, did he turn to the title-page.  It seemed
to him then that on his lonely rock some solemnity
was about to take place.  Indeed it was a moment
of great calm and silence.  The clocks of Aspinwall
were striking five in the afternoon.  Not a cloud
darkened the clear sky; only a few sea-mews were
sailing through the air.  The ocean was as if cradled
to sleep.  The waves on the shore stammered
quietly, spreading softly on the sand.  In the
distance the white houses of Aspinwall, and the
wonderful groups of palm, were smiling.  In truth,
there was something there solemn, calm, and full
of dignity.  Suddenly, in the midst of that calm of
Nature, was heard the trembling voice of the old
man, who read aloud as if to understand himself
better:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thou art like health, O my birth-land Litva![<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>]<br />
  How much we should prize thee he only can know who has lost thee.<br />
  Thy beauty in perfect adornment this day<br />
  I see and describe, because I am yearning for thee."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] Mickiewicz (pronounced Mitskyevich), the greatest poet of Poland.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn2text">2</a>] Lithuania.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
His voice failed Skavinski.  The letters began to
dance before his eyes; something broke in his breast,
and went like a wave from his heart higher and
higher, choking his voice and pressing his throat.  A
moment more he controlled himself, and read
further:
</p>

<p>
  "O Holy Lady, who guardest bright Chenstohova,<br />
  Who shinest in Ostrobrama and preservest<br />
  The castle town Novgrodek with its trusty people,<br />
  As Thou didst give me back to health in childhood,<br />
  When by my weeping mother placed beneath Thy care<br />
  I raised my lifeless eyelids upward,<br />
  And straightway walked unto Thy holy threshold,<br />
  To thank God for the life restored me,&mdash;<br />
  So by a wonder now restore us to the bosom of our birthplace."<br />
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
The swollen wave broke through the restraint of
his will.  The old man sobbed, and threw himself on
the ground; his milk-white hair was mingled with
the sand of the sea.  Forty years had passed since
he had seen his country, and God knows how many
since he heard his native speech; and now that
speech had come to him itself&mdash;it had sailed to him
over the ocean, and found him in solitude on another
hemisphere,&mdash;it so loved, so dear, so beautiful!  In
the sobbing which shook him there was no pain,&mdash;only
a suddenly aroused immense love, in the
presence of which other things are as nothing.  With
that great weeping he had simply implored forgiveness
of that beloved one, set aside because he had
grown so old, had become so accustomed to his
solitary rock, and had so forgotten it that in him
even longing had begun to disappear.  But now it
returned as if by a miracle; therefore the heart
leaped in him.
</p>

<p>
Moments vanished one after another; he lay
there continually.  The mews flew over the lighthouse,
crying as if alarmed for their old friend.  The
hour in which he fed them with the remnants of his
food had come; therefore, some of them flew down
from the lighthouse to him; then more and more
came, and began to pick and shake their wings over
his head.  The sound of the wings roused him.  He
had wept his fill, and had now a certain calm
brightness; but his eyes were as if inspired.  He gave
unwittingly all his provisions to the birds, which rushed
at him in uproar, and he himself took the book again.
The sun had gone already behind the gardens and
the forest of Panama, and was going slowly beyond
the isthmus to the other ocean; but the Atlantic
was full of light yet; in the open air there was still
perfect vision; therefore, he read further:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Now bear my longing soul to those forest slopes, to those
green meadows."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At last the dusk obliterates the letters on the white
paper&mdash;the dusk short as a twinkle.  The old man
rested his head on the rock, and closed his eyes.
Then "She who defends bright Chenstohova" took
his soul, and transported it to "those fields coloured
by various grain."  On the sky were burning yet those
long stripes, red and golden, and on those brightnesses
he was flying to beloved regions.  The pine-woods
were sounding in his ears; the streams of his
native place were murmuring.  He saw everything
as it was; everything asked him, "Dost remember?"  He
remembers! he sees broad fields; between the
fields, woods and villages.  It is night now.  At this
hour his lantern usually illuminates the darkness of
the sea; but now he is in his native village.  His old
head dropped on his breast, and he is dreaming.
Pictures are passing before his eyes quickly, and a
little disorderly.  He does not see the house in which
he was born, for war had destroyed it; he does not
see his father and mother, for they died when he was
a child; but still the village is as if he had left it
yesterday,&mdash;the line of cottages with lights in the
windows, the mound, the mill, the two ponds
opposite each other, and thundering all night with a
chorus of frogs.  Once he had been on guard in that
village all night; now that past stood before him at
once in a series of views.  He is an Ulan again, and
he stands there on guard; at a distance is the
public-house; he looks with swimming eyes.  There
thundering and singing and shouting amid the
silence of the night with voices of fiddles and
bass-viols "U-ha!  U-ha!"  Then the Ulans knock out
fire with their horseshoes, and it is wearisome for
him there on his horse.  The hours drag on slowly;
at last the lights are quenched; now as far as the eye
reaches there is mist, and mist impenetrable; now
the fog rises, evidently from the fields, and embraces
the whole world with a whitish cloud.  You would
say, a complete ocean.  But those are fields; soon
the land-rail will be heard in the darkness, and the
bitterns will call from the reeds.  The night is calm
and cool,&mdash;in truth, a Polish night!  In the distance
the pine-wood is sounding without wind, like the
roll of the sea.  Soon dawn will whiten the East.
In fact, the cocks are beginning to crow behind the
hedges.  One answers to another from cottage to
cottage; the storks are screaming somewhere on
high.  The Ulan feels well and bright.  Some one
had spoken of a battle to-morrow.  Hei! that will
go on, like all the others, with shouting, with
fluttering of flaglets.  The young blood is playing like a
trumpet, though the night cools it.  But it is
dawning.  Already night is growing pale; out of the
shadows come forests, the thicket, a row of cottages, the
mill, the poplars.  The well is squeaking like a metal
banner on a tower.  What a beloved land, beautiful
in the rosy gleams of the morning!  Oh, the one
land, the one land!
</p>

<p>
Quiet! the watchful picket hears that some one is
approaching.  Of course, they are coming to relieve
the guard.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly some voice is heard above Skavinski,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Here, old man!  Get up!  What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
The old man opens his eyes, and looks with
wonder at the person standing before him.  The
remnants of the dream-visions struggle in his head
with reality.  At last the visions pale and vanish.
Before him stands Johnson, the harbour guide.
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" asked Johnson; "are you sick?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't light the lantern.  You must leave
your place.  A vessel from St. Geromo was wrecked
at the bar.  It is lucky that no one was drowned, or
you would go to trial.  Get into the boat with me;
you'll hear the rest at the Consulate."
</p>

<p>
The old man grew pale; in fact he had not lighted
the lantern that night.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, Skavinski was seen on the deck
of a steamer, which was going from Aspinwall to
New York.  The poor man had lost his place.  There
opened before him new roads of wandering; the wind
had torn that leaf away again to whirl it over lands
and seas, to sport with it till satisfied.  The old man
had failed greatly during those few days, and was
bent over; only his eyes were gleaming.  On his
new road of life he held at his breast his book, which
from time to time he pressed with his hand as if in
fear that that too might go from him.

It was yesterday, the 31st of December.

<p>
I had just finished breakfast with my old
friend Georges Garin when the servant handed
him a letter covered with seals and foreign stamps.
</p>

<p>
Georges said:
</p>

<p>
"Will you excuse me?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
And so he began to read the letter, which was
written in a large English handwriting, crossed
and re-crossed in every direction.  He read slowly,
with serious attention and the interest which we
only pay to things that touch our hearts.
</p>

<p>
Then he put the letter on the mantel-piece and
said:
</p>

<p>
"That was a curious story!  I've never told you
about it, I think.  Yet it was a sentimental
adventure, and it really happened to me.  That was a
strange New Year's Day indeed!  It must have
been twenty years ago, since I was then thirty, and
am now fifty years old.
</p>

<p>
"I was then an inspector in the Maritime Insurance
Company, of which I am now director.  I had
arranged to pass the <i>fête</i> of New Year's in Paris&mdash;since
it is a convention to make that day a <i>fête</i>&mdash;when
I received a letter from the manager, asking
me to proceed at once to the island of Ré, where a
three-masted vessel from Saint-Nazaire, insured by
us, had just been driven ashore.  It was then eight
o'clock in the morning.  I arrived at the office at
ten, to get my advices, and that evening I took the
express, which put me down in La Rochelle the next
day, the thirty-first of December.
</p>

<p>
"I had two hours to wait before going aboard
the boat for Ré.  So I made a tour in the town.
It is certainly a fantastic city, La Rochelle, with
a strong character of its own&mdash;streets tangled like
a labyrinth, sidewalks running under endless arcaded
galleries like those of the Rue de Rivoli, but low,
mysterious, built as if to form a fit scene for
conspirators, and making an ancient and striking
background for those old-time wars, the savage heroic
wars of religion.  It is indeed the typical old
Huguenot city, conservative, discreet, with no fine art to
show, with no wonderful monuments, such as make
Rouen; but it is remarkable for its severe, somewhat
cunning look; it is a city of obstinate fighters, a city
where fanaticisms might well blossom, where the
faith of the Calvinists became exalted, and which
gave birth to the plot of the 'Four Sergeants.'
</p>

<p>
"After I had wandered for some time about these
curious streets, I went aboard the black, rotund
little steamboat which was to take me to the island
of Ré.  It was called the <i>Jean Guiton</i>.  It started
with angry puffings, passed between the two old
towers which guard the harbour, crossed the
roadstead, and issued from the mole built by Richelieu,
the great stones of which can be seen at the water's
edge, enclosing the town like a great necklace.  Then
the steamboat turned to the right.
</p>

<p>
"It was one of those sad days which give one the
blues, tighten the heart and kill in us all energy and
force&mdash;a gray, cold day, with a heavy mist which
was as wet as rain, as cold as frost, as bad to breathe
as the mist of a wash-tub.
</p>

<p>
"Under this low ceiling of sinister fog, the shallow,
yellow, sandy sea of all gradually receding coasts
lay without a wrinkle, without a movement, without
life, a sea of turbid water, greasy water, of stagnant
water.  The <i>Jean Guiton</i> passed over it, rolling a
little from habit, dividing the smooth, dark blue
water, and leaving behind a little chopping sea, a
few big waves, which were soon calm.
</p>

<p>
"I began to talk to the captain, a little man with
small feet, as round as his boat and balancing himself
like it.  I wanted some details about the disaster
on which I was to give a report.  A great square-rigged
three-master, the <i>Marie Joseph</i>, of Saint-Nazaire,
had gone ashore one night in a hurricane
on the sands of the island of Ré.
</p>

<p>
"The owner wrote us that the storm had thrown
the ship so far ashore that it was impossible to
float her, and that they had to remove everything
which could be detached, with the utmost possible
haste.  Nevertheless, I must examine the situation
of the wreck, estimate what must have been her
condition before the disaster, and decide whether
all efforts had been used to get her afloat.  I came
as an agent of the company in order to give
contradictory testimony, if necessary, at the trial.
</p>

<p>
"On receipt of my report, the manager would
take what measures he might think necessary to
protect our interests.
</p>

<p>
"The captain of the <i>Jean Guiton</i> knew all about
the affair, having been summoned with his boat to
assist in the attempts at salvage.
</p>

<p>
"He told me the story of the disaster.  The
<i>Marie Joseph</i>, driven by a furious gale, lost her
bearings completely, in the night, and steering by
chance over a heavy foaming sea&mdash;'a milk-soup
sea,' said the captain&mdash;had gone ashore on those
immense banks of sand which make the coasts of
this country seem like limitless Saharas at hours
when the tide is low.
</p>

<p>
"While talking I looked around and ahead.
Between the ocean and the lowering sky lay a free
space where the eye could see far.  We were
following a coast.  I asked:
</p>

<p>
"'Is that the island of Ré?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
"And suddenly the captain stretched his right
hand out before us, pointed to something almost
invisible in the middle of the sea, and said:
</p>

<p>
"'There's your ship!'
</p>

<p>
"'The <i>Marie Joseph</i>?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
"I was stupefied.  This black, almost imperceptible
speck, which looked to me like a rock,
seemed at least three miles from land.
</p>

<p>
"I continued:
</p>

<p>
"'But, captain, there must be a hundred fathoms
of water in that place.'
</p>

<p>
"He began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"'A hundred fathoms, my child!  Well, I should
say about two!'
</p>

<p>
"He was from Bordeaux.  He continued:
</p>

<p>
"'It's now nine-forty, just high tide.  Go down
along the beach with your hands in your pockets
after you've had lunch at the Hotel du Dauphin,
and I'll wager that at ten minutes to three, or three
o'clock, you'll reach the wreck without wetting
your feet, and have from an hour and three-quarters
to two hours aboard of her; but not more, or you'll
be caught.  The faster the sea goes out the faster it
comes back.  This coast is as flat as a turtle!  But
start away at ten minutes to five, as I tell you, and
at half-past seven you will be aboard of the <i>Jean
Guiton</i> again, which will put you down this same
evening on the quay at La Rochelle.'
</p>

<p>
"I thanked the captain, and I went and sat
down in the bow of the steamer to get a good look
at the little city of Saint-Martin, which we were
now rapidly drawing near.
</p>

<p>
"It was just like all small seaports which serve
as the capitals of the barren islands scattered along
the coast&mdash;a large fishing village, one foot on sea
and one on shore, living on fish and wild-fowl,
vegetables and shell-fish, radishes and mussels.
The island is very low, and little cultivated, yet it
seems to be thickly populated.  However, I did
not penetrate into the interior.
</p>

<p>
"After breakfast I climbed across a little
promontory, and then, as the tide was rapidly falling,
I started out across the sands toward a kind of
black rock which I could just perceive above the
surface of the water, out a considerable distance.
</p>

<p>
"I walked quickly over the yellow plain; it was
elastic, like flesh, and seemed to sweat beneath my
foot.  The sea had been there very lately; now I
perceived it at a distance, escaping out of sight, and
I no longer could distinguish the line which separated
the sands from ocean.  I felt as though I were
assisting at a gigantic supernatural work of
enchantment.  The Atlantic had just now been before me,
then it had disappeared into the strand, just as does
scenery through a trap; and I now walked in the
midst of a desert.  Only the feeling, the breath of
the salt-water, remained in me.  I perceived the
smell of the wreck, the smell of the wide sea, the
good smell of sea-coasts.  I walked fast; I was no
longer cold; I looked at the stranded wreck, which
grew in size as I approached, and came now to
resemble an enormous shipwrecked whale.
</p>

<p>
"It seemed fairly to rise out of the ground, and
on that great, flat, yellow stretch of sand assumed
wonderful proportions.  After an hour's walk I at
last reached it.  Bulging out and crushed, it lay
upon its side, which, like the flanks of an animal,
displayed its broken bones, its bones of tarry wood
pierced with great bolts.  The sand had already
invaded it, entering it by all the crannies, and held
it, and refused to let it go.  It seemed to have taken
root in it.  The bow had entered deep into this
soft, treacherous beach; while the stern, high in
air, seemed to cast at heaven, like a cry of despairing
appeal, the two white words on the black planking,
<i>Marie Joseph</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I climbed upon this carcass of a ship by the
lowest side; then, having reached the deck, I went
below.  The daylight, which entered by the stove-in
hatches and the cracks in the sides, showed me a
long somber cellar full of demolished woodwork.
There was nothing here but the sand, which served
as foot-soil in this cavern of planks.
</p>

<p>
"I began to take some notes about the condition
of the ship.  I was seated on a broken empty cask,
writing by the light of a great crack, through which
I could perceive the boundless stretch of the strand.
A strange shivering of cold and loneliness ran over
my skin from time to time; and I would often stop
writing for a moment to listen to the mysterious
noises: the noise of the crabs scratching the planking
with their crooked claws; the noise of a thousand
little creatures of the sea already crawling over this
dead body.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly, very near me, I heard human voices;
I started as though I had seen a ghost.  For a
second I really thought I was about to see drowned
men rise from the sinister depths of the hold, who
would tell me about their death.  At any rate, it
did not take me long to swing myself on deck.
There, below the bow, I found standing a tall Englishman
with three young girls.  Certainly, they were a
good deal more frightened at seeing this sudden
apparition on the abandoned three-master than I
had been at seeing them.  The youngest girl turned
round and ran; the two others caught their father
by the arms; as for him, he opened his mouth&mdash;that
was the only sign of his emotion which he showed.
</p>

<p>
"Then, after several seconds, he spoke:
</p>

<p>
"'Môsieu, are you the owner of this ship?'
</p>

<p>
"'I am.'
</p>

<p>
"'May I go over it?"
</p>

<p>
"'You may.'
</p>

<p>
"Then he uttered a long sentence in English,
in which I only distinguished the word 'gracious,'
repeated several times.
</p>

<p>
"As he was looking for a place to climb up, I
showed him the best, and gave him a hand.  He
ascended.  Then we helped up the three little girls,
who had now quite recovered their composure.
They were charming, especially the oldest, a blonde
of eighteen, fresh as a flower, and very dainty and
pretty!  Ah yes! the pretty Englishwomen have
indeed the look of tender fruits of the sea.  One
would have said of this one that she had just risen
from the sands and that her hair had kept their tint.
They all, with their exquisite freshness, make you
think of the delicate colours of pink sea-shells, and
of shining pearls hidden in the unknown depths of
the ocean.
</p>

<p>
"She spoke French a little better than her father,
and she acted as interpreter.  I must tell all about
the shipwreck, and I romanced as though I had been
present at the catastrophe.  Then the whole family
descended into the interior of the wreck.  As soon
as they had penetrated into this sombre, dim-lit
gallery, they uttered cries of astonishment and
admiration.  Suddenly the father and his three
daughters were holding sketch-books in their hands,
which they had doubtless carried hidden somewhere
in their heavy weather-proof clothes, and were all
beginning at once to make pencil sketches of the
melancholy and fantastic place.
</p>

<p>
"They had seated themselves side by side on a
projecting beam, and the four sketch-books on the
eight knees were being rapidly covered with little
black lines which were intended to represent the
half-opened hulk of the <i>Marie Joseph</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I continued to inspect the skeleton of the ship,
and the oldest girl talked to me while she worked.
</p>

<p>
"They had none of the usual English arrogance;
they were simple honest hearts of that class of
constant travellers with which England covers the
globe.  The father was long and thin, with a red
face framed in white whiskers, and looking like a
living sandwich, placed between two wedges of
hair.  The daughters, like little wading-birds in
embryo, had long legs and were also thin&mdash;except
the oldest.  All three were pretty, especially the
tallest.
</p>

<p>
"She had such a droll way of speaking, of laughing,
of understanding and of not understanding, of
raising her eyes to ask a question (eyes blue as the
deep ocean), of stopping her drawing a moment to
make a guess at what you meant, of returning once
more to work, of saying 'yes' or 'no'&mdash;that I could
have listened and looked indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly she murmured:
</p>

<p>
"'I hear a little movement on this boat.'
</p>

<p>
"I lent an ear; and I immediately distinguished
a low, steady, curious sound.  I rose and looked
out of the crack, and I uttered a violent cry.  The
sea had come back; it had already surrounded us!
</p>

<p>
"We were on deck in an instant.  It was too late.
The water circled us about, and was running towards
the coast with awful swiftness.  No, it did not
run, it raced, it grew longer, like a kind of great
limitless blot.  The water on the sands was barely
a few centimeters deep; but the rising flood had
gone so far that we no longer saw the flying line of
its edge.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman wanted to jump.  I held him
back.  Flight was impossible because of the deep
places which we had been obliged to go round on our
way out, and through which we could not pass on
our return.
</p>

<p>
"There was a minute of horrible anguish in our
hearts.  Then the little English girl began to smile,
and murmured:
</p>

<p>
"'So we too are shipwrecked?'
</p>

<p>
"I tried to laugh; but fear caught me tight, a fear
which was cowardly and horrid and base and mean,
like the tide.  All the dangers which we ran
appeared to me at once.  I wanted to shriek
'Help!'  But to whom?
</p>

<p>
"The two younger girls were clinging to their
father, who regarded, with a look of consternation,
the measureless sea which hedged us round about.
</p>

<p>
"The night fell as swiftly as the ocean rose&mdash;a
lowering, wet, icy night.
</p>

<p>
"I said:
</p>

<p>
"'There's nothing to do but to stay on the ship.'
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman answered:
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, yes!'
</p>

<p>
"And we waited there a quarter of an hour, half
an hour, indeed I don't know how long, watching
that creeping water which grew deep about us,
whirled round and round the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"One of the little girls was cold, and we went below
to shelter ourselves from the light but freezing wind
which blew upon us and pricked our skins.
</p>

<p>
"I leaned over the hatchway.  The ship was full
of water.  So we must cower against the stern
planking, which shielded us a little.
</p>

<p>
"The shades were now enwrapping us, and we
remained pressed close to one another.  I felt
trembling against my shoulder the shoulder of the little
English girl, whose teeth chattered from time to
time.  But I also felt the gentle warmth of her body
through her ulster, and that warmth was as delicious
to me as a kiss.  We no longer spoke; we sat motionless,
mute, cowering down like animals in a ditch
when a hurricane is raging.  And, nevertheless,
despite the night, despite the terrible and increasing
danger, I began to feel happy that I was there, glad
of the cold and the peril, to rejoice in the long hours
of darkness and anguish which I must pass on this
plank so near this dainty and pretty little girl.
</p>

<p>
"I asked myself, 'Why this strange sensation of
well-being and of joy?'
</p>

<p>
"Why!  Does one know?  Because she was there?
Who?  She, a little unknown English girl?  I did
not love her, I did not even know her.  And for all
that I was touched and conquered.  I wanted to
save her, to sacrifice myself for her, to commit a
thousand follies!  Strange thing!  How does it
happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms
us so?  Is it the power of her grace which infolds us?
Is it the seduction in her beauty and youth, which
intoxicates one like wine?
</p>

<p>
"Is it not rather the touch of Love, of Love the
Mysterious, who seeks constantly to unite two
beings, who tries his strength the instant he has put
a man and a woman face to face?
</p>

<p>
"The silence of the shades and of the sky became
dreadful, because we could thus hear vaguely about
us an infinite low roar, the dull sound of the rising
sea, and the monotonous dashing of the waves
against the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly I heard the sound of sobs.  The youngest
of the little girls was crying.  Her father tried to
console her, and they began to talk in their own
tongue, which I did not understand.  I guessed
that he was reassuring her, and that she was still
afraid.
</p>

<p>
"I asked my neighbour:
</p>

<p>
"'You are not too cold, are you, Mademoiselle?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, yes.  I am very cold.'
</p>

<p>
"I offered to give her my cloak; she refused it.
But I had taken it off, and I covered her with it
against her will.  In the short struggle her hand
touched mine.  It made a charming shiver run over
my body.
</p>

<p>
"For some minutes the air had been growing
brisker, the dashing of the water stronger against the
flanks of the ship.  I raised myself; a great gust of
wind blew in my face.  The wind was rising!
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman perceived this at the same time
that I did, and said, simply:
</p>

<p>
"'This is bad for us, this&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"Of course it was bad, it was certain death if any
breakers, however feeble, should attack and shake
the wreck, which was already so loose and broken
that the first big sea would carry it off.
</p>

<p>
"So our anguish increased momentarily as the
squalls grew stronger and stronger.  Now the sea
broke a little, and I saw in the darkness white lines
appearing and disappearing, which were lines of
foam; while each wave struck the <i>Marie Joseph</i>, and
shook her with a short quiver which rose to our
hearts.
</p>

<p>
"The English girl was trembling; I felt her shiver
against me.  And I had a wild desire to take her in
my arms.
</p>

<p>
"Down there before and behind us, to left and
right, lighthouses were shining along the
shore&mdash;lighthouses white and yellow and red, revolving like
the enormous eyes of giants who were staring at us,
watching us, waiting eagerly for us to disappear.
One of them in especial irritated me.  It went out
every thirty seconds and it lit up again as soon.  It
was indeed an eye, that one, with its lid ceaselessly
lowered over its fiery look.
</p>

<p>
"From time to time the Englishman struck a
match to see the hour; then he put his watch back
in his pocket.  Suddenly he said to me, over the
heads of his daughters, with a gravity which was
awful:
</p>

<p>
"'I wish you a Happy New Year, Môsieu.'
</p>

<p>
"It was midnight.  I held out my hand, which he
pressed.  Then he said something in English, and
suddenly he and his daughters began to sing 'God
Save the Queen,' which rose through the black and
silent air and vanished into space.
</p>

<p>
"At first I felt a desire to laugh; then I was
seized by a strong, fantastic emotion.
</p>

<p>
"It was something sinister and superb, this chant
of the shipwrecked, the condemned, something like
a prayer, and also something grander, something
comparable to the ancient '<i>Ave Cæsar morituri te
salutamus</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"When they had finished I asked my neighbour
to sing a ballad alone, anything she liked, to make
us forget our terrors.  She consented, and immediately
her clear young voice rang out into the night.
She sang something which was doubtless sad,
because the notes were long drawn out, and hovered,
like wounded birds, about the waves.
</p>

<p>
"The sea was rising now and beating upon our
wreck.  As for me, I thought only of that voice.
And I thought also of the sirens.  If a ship had passed
nearby us what would the sailors have said?  My
troubled spirit lost itself in the dream!  A siren!
Was she not really a siren, this daughter of the sea,
who had kept me on this worm-eaten ship, and who
was soon about to go down with me deep into the
waters?
</p>

<p>
"But suddenly we were all five rolling on the
deck, because the <i>Marie Joseph</i> had sunk on her
right side.  The English girl had fallen upon me,
and before I knew what I was doing, thinking
that my last moment was come, I had caught her
in my arms and kissed her cheek, her temple, and
her hair.
</p>

<p>
"The ship did not move again, and we, we also,
remained motionless.
</p>

<p>
"The father said, 'Kate!'  The one whom I was
holding answered, 'Yes,' and made a movement to
free herself.  And at that moment I should have
wished the ship to split in two and let me fall with
her into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman continued:
</p>

<p>
"'A little rocking; it's nothing.  I have my three
daughters safe.'
</p>

<p>
"Not having seen the oldest, he had thought she
was lost overboard!
</p>

<p>
"I rose slowly, and suddenly I made out a light
on the sea quite near us.  I shouted; they answered.
It was a boat sent out in search of us by the
hotel-keeper, who had guessed at our imprudence.
</p>

<p>
"We were saved.  I was in despair.  They picked
us up off our raft, and they brought us back to
Saint-Martin.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman began to rub his hands and
murmur:
</p>

<p>
"'A good supper!  A good supper!'
</p>

<p>
"We did sup.  I was not gay.  I regretted the
<i>Marie Joseph</i>.
</p>

<p>
"We had to separate the next day after much
handshaking and many promises to write.  They
departed for Biarritz.  I wanted to follow them.
</p>

<p>
"I was hard hit; I wanted to ask this little girl
to marry me.  If we had passed eight days together,
I should have done so!  How weak and incomprehensible
a man sometimes is!
</p>

<p>
"Two years passed without my hearing a word
from them.  Then I received a letter from New York.
She was married, and wrote to tell me.  And since
then we write to each other every year, on New
Year's Day.  She tells me about her life, talks of her
children, her sisters, never of her husband!  Why?
Ah! why? ... And as for me I only talk of the
<i>Marie Joseph</i>.  That was perhaps the only woman
I have ever loved.  No&mdash;that I ever should have
loved....  Ah, well! who can tell?  Facts
master you....  And then&mdash;and then&mdash;all
passes....  She must be old now; I should
not know her....  Ah! she of the by-gone time,
she of the wreck!  What a creature! ... Divine! ... She
writes me her hair is white....
That caused me terrible pain....
Ah! her yellow hair....  No, my English girl
exists no longer....  They are sad, such things
as that!"

We had now reached the summit of the

seemed too much exhausted to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Not long ago," said he at length, "and I could
have guided you on this route as well as the youngest
of my sons; but, about three years past, there
happened to me an event such as never happened before
to mortal man&mdash;or at least such as no man ever

from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and
to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least
exertion, and am frightened at a shadow.  Do you
know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without
getting giddy?"
</p>

<p>
The "little cliff," upon whose edge he had so carelessly
thrown himself down to rest, that the weightier
portion of his body hung over it, while he was only
kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its
extreme and slippery edge&mdash;this "little cliff" arose,
a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock,
some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world
of crags beneath us.  Nothing would have tempted
me to within half-a-dozen yards of its brink.  In
truth, so deeply was I excited by the perilous position
of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the
ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared
not even glance upward at the sky&mdash;while I struggled
in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very
foundations of the mountain were in danger from
the fury of the winds.  It was long before I could
reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and
look out into the distance.
</p>

<p>
"You must get over these fancies," said the guide,
"for I have brought you here that you might have
the best possible view of the scene of that event I
mentioned&mdash;and to tell you the whole story with the
spot just under your eye.
</p>

<p>
"We are now," he continued, in that particularising
manner which distinguished him&mdash;"we are now
close upon the Norwegian coast&mdash;in the sixty-eighth
degree of latitude&mdash;in the great province of
Nordland&mdash;and in the dreary district of Lofoden.  The
mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the
Cloudy.  Now raise yourself up a little higher&mdash;hold
on to the grass if you feel giddy&mdash;so&mdash;and look
out, beyond the belt of vapour beneath us, into
the sea."
</p>

<p>
I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of
ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring
at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's account
of the Mare Tenebrarum.  A panorama more deplorably
desolate no human imagination can conceive.
To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach,
there lay out-stretched, like ramparts of the world,
lines of horribly black and beetling cliff, whose
character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated
by the surf which reared high up against it its white
and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever.
Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we
were placed, and at a distance of some five or six
miles out at sea, there was visible a small,
bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was
discernible through the wilderness of surge in which
it was enveloped.  About two miles nearer the land,
arose another of smaller size, hideously craggy and
barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a
cluster of dark rocks.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the ocean, in the space between
the more distant island and the shore, had something
very unusual about it.  Although, at the time, so
strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the
remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail,
and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight,
still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but
only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in
every direction&mdash;as well in the teeth of the wind as
otherwise.  Of foam there was little except in the
immediate vicinity of the rocks.
</p>

<p>
"The island in the distance," resumed the old
man, "is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh.  The
one mid-way is Moskoe.  That a mile to the
northward is Ambaaren.  Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm,
Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm.  Farther
off&mdash;between Moskoe and Vurrgh&mdash;are Otterholm,
Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm.  These are the
true names of the places&mdash;but why it has been
thought necessary to name them at all, is more than
either you or I can understand.  Do you hear
anything?  Do you see any change in the water?"
</p>

<p>
We had now been about ten minutes upon the top
of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from the
interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse
of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit.
As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and
gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a
vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;
and at the same moment I perceived what seamen
term the <i>chopping</i> character of the ocean beneath us,
was rapidly changing into a current which set to the
eastward.  Even while I gazed, this current acquired
a monstrous velocity.  Each moment added to its
speed&mdash;to its headlong impetuosity.  In five minutes
the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into
ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and
the coast that the main uproar held its sway.  Here
the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into
a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into
frenzied convulsion&mdash;heaving, boiling, hissing&mdash;gyrating
in gigantic and innumerable vortices, and
all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a
rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes,
except in precipitous descents.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes more, there came over the scene
another radical alteration.  The general surface grew
somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by
one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam
became apparent where none had been seen before.
These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great
distance, and entering into combination, took unto
themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided
vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more
vast.  Suddenly&mdash;very suddenly&mdash;this assumed a
distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more
than a mile in diameter.  The edge of the whirl
was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray;
but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the
terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could
fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall
of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some
forty-five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round
with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending
forth to the winds an appalling voice, half-shriek,
half-roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of
Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.
</p>

<p>
The mountain trembled to its very base, and the
rock rocked.  I threw myself upon my face, and
clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous
agitation.
</p>

<p>
"This," said I at length, to the old man&mdash;"this
can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the
Maelström."
</p>

<p>
"So it is sometimes termed," said he.  "We
Norwegians call it the Moskoe-ström, from the island
of Moskoe in the midway."
</p>

<p>
The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no
means prepared me for what I saw.  That of Jonas
Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of
any, cannot impart the faintest conception either of
the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene&mdash;or of
the wild bewildering sense of the novel which
confounds the beholder.  I am not sure from what point
of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at
what time; but it could neither have been from the
summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm.  There are
some passages of his description, nevertheless, which
may be quoted for their details, although their effect
is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of
the spectacle.
</p>

<p>
"Between Lofoden and Moskoe," he says, "the
depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty
fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh),
this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient
passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on
the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather.
When it is flood, the stream runs up the country
between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous
rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea
is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful
cataracts, the noise being heard several leagues off;
and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and
depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it is
inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom,
and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when
the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown
up again.  But these intervals of tranquillity are
only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in calm
weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its
violence gradually returning.  When the stream is
most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm,
it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it.
Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by
not guarding against it before they were within its
reach.  It likewise happens frequently, that whales
come too near the stream, and are overpowered by
its violence; and then it is impossible to describe
their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless
struggles to disengage themselves.  A bear once,
attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by
the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly,
so as to be heard on shore.  Large stocks of firs and
pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise
again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles
grew upon them.  This plainly shows the bottom to
consist of craggy rocks, among which they are
whirled to and fro.  This stream is regulated by the
flux and reflux of the sea&mdash;it being constantly high
and low water every six hours.  In the year 1645,
early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged
with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones
of the houses on the coast fell to the ground."
</p>

<p>
In regard to the depth of the water, I could not
see how this could have been ascertained at all in the
immediate vicinity of the vortex.  The "forty
fathoms" must have reference only to portions of the
channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or
Lofoden.  The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-ström
must be immeasurably greater; and no better
proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained
from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the
whirl which may be had from the highest crag of
Helseggen.  Looking down from this pinnacle upon
the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help
smiling at the simplicity with which the honest Jonas
Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the
anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it
appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the
largest ships of the line in existence, coming within
the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist
it as little as a feather in the hurricane, and must
disappear bodily and at once.
</p>

<p>
The attempts to account for the phenomenon&mdash;some
of which, I remember, seemed to me sufficiently
plausible in perusal&mdash;now wore a very different and
unsatisfactory aspect.  The idea generally received
is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among
the Faroe Islands, "have no other cause than the
collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and
reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which
confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a
cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the
deeper must the fall be, and the natural result of
all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction
of which is sufficiently known by lesser
experiments."&mdash;These are the words of the Encyclopædia
Britannica.  Kircher and others imagine that in
the centre of the channel of the Maelström is an
abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some
very remote part&mdash;the Gulf of Bothnia being
somewhat decidedly named in one instance.  This
opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as I
gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and,
mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised
to hear him say that, although it was the view
almost universally entertained of the subject by
the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own.
As to the former notion, he confessed his inability
to comprehend it; and here I agreed with him&mdash;for,
however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether
unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder
of the abyss.
</p>

<p>
"You have had a good look at the whirl now,"
said the old man, "and if you will creep round this
crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of
the water, I will tell you a story that will convince
you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström."
</p>

<p>
I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.
</p>

<p>
"Myself and my two brothers once owned a
schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burden,
with which we were in the habit of fishing among the
islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh.  In all
violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper
opportunities, if one has only the courage to
attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden
coast-men, we three were the only ones who made a
regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell
you.  The usual grounds are a great way lower
down to the southward.  There fish can be got at
all hours, without much risk, and therefore these
places are preferred.  The choice spots over here
among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest
variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we
often got in a single day, what the more timid of
the craft could not scrape together in a week.  In
fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation&mdash;the
risk of life standing instead of labour, and
courage answering for capital.
</p>

<p>
"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles
higher up the coast than this; and it was our practice,
in fine weather, to take advantage of the fifteen
minutes' slack to push across the main channel of
the Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then
drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm,
or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so
violent as elsewhere.  Here we used to remain until
nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed
and made for home.  We never set out upon this
expedition without a steady side wind for going
and coming&mdash;one that we felt sure would not fail
us before our return&mdash;and we seldom made a
miscalculation upon this point.  Twice, during six
years, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on
account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed
just about here; and once we had to remain on the
grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a
gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and
made the channel too boisterous to be thought of.
Upon this occasion we should have been driven out
to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools
threw us round and round so violently, that, at
length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it
had not been that we drifted into one of the
innumerable cross currents&mdash;here to-day and gone
to-morrow&mdash;which drove us under the lee of Flimen,
where, by good luck, we brought up.
</p>

<p>
"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the
difficulties we encountered 'on the ground'&mdash;it is a
bad spot to be in, even in good weather&mdash;but we made
shift always to run the gauntlet of the Moskoe-ström
itself without accident; although at times my heart
has been in my mouth when we happened to be a
minute or so behind or before the slack.  The wind
sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at
starting, and then we made rather less way than we
could wish, while the current rendered the smack
unmanageable.  My eldest brother had a son eighteen
years old, and I had two stout boys of my own.
These would have been of great assistance at such
times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in
fishing&mdash;but, somehow, although we ran the risk
ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young
ones get into danger&mdash;for, after all said and done,
it was a horrible danger, and that is the truth.
</p>

<p>
"It is now within a few days of three years since
what I am going to tell you occurred.  It was on the
10th of July, 18&mdash;, a day which the people of this
part of the world will never forget&mdash;for it was one in
which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever
came out of the heavens.  And yet all the morning,
and indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a
gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,
while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest
seaman among us could not have foreseen what
was to follow.
</p>

<p>
"The three of us&mdash;my two brothers and myself&mdash;had
crossed over to the islands about two o'clock.
P.M., and soon nearly loaded the smack with fine
fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that
day than we had ever known them.  It was just
seven, by my watch, when we weighed and started
for home, so as to make the worst of the Ström
at slack water, which we knew would be at eight.
</p>

<p>
"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard
quarter, and for some time spanked along at a great
rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed we saw not
the slightest reason to apprehend it.  All at once we
were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen.
This was most unusual&mdash;something that had never
happened to us before&mdash;and I began to feel a little
uneasy, without exactly knowing why.  We put
the boat on the wind, but could make no headway at
all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of
proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking
astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a
singular copper-coloured cloud that rose with the
most amazing velocity.
</p>

<p>
"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us
off fell away, and we were dead becalmed, drifting
about in every direction.  This state of things,
however, did not last long enough to give us time to
think about it.  In less than a minute the storm
was upon us&mdash;in less than two the sky was entirely
overcast&mdash;and what with this and the driving spray,
it became suddenly so dark that we could not see
each other in the smack.
</p>

<p>
"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to
attempt describing.  The oldest seamen in Norway
never experienced anything like it.  We had let
our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us;
but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the
board as if they had been sawed off&mdash;the mainmast
taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed
himself to it for safety.
</p>

<p>
"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that
ever sat upon water.  It had a complete flush deck,
with only a small hatch near the bow, and this hatch
it had always been our custom to batten down when
about to cross the Ström, by way of precaution
against the chopping seas.  But for this
circumstance we should have foundered at once&mdash;for we
lay entirely buried for some moments.  How my
elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I
never had an opportunity of ascertaining.  For my
part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw
myself flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow
gunwale of the bow, and with my hands grasping
a ring-bolt near the foot of the foremast.  It was
mere instinct that prompted me to do this&mdash;which
was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have
done&mdash;for I was too much flurried to think.
</p>

<p>
"For some moments we were completely deluged,
as I say, and all this time I held my breath, and
clung to the bolt.  When I could stand it no longer, I
raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with
my hands, and thus got my head clear.  Presently
our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog
does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself,
in some measure, of the seas.  I was now trying to
get the better of the stupor that had come over me,
and to collect my senses, so as to see what was to be
done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm.  It was
my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for
I had made sure that he was overboard; but the
next moment all this joy was turned into horror,
for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed
out the word '<i>Moskoe-ström</i>!'
</p>

<p>
"No one ever will know what my feelings were
at that moment.  I shook from head to foot as if
I had the most violent fit of the ague.  I knew
what he meant by that one word well enough&mdash;I
knew what he wished to make me understand.
With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound
for the whirl of the Ström, and nothing could save us!
</p>

<p>
"You perceive that in crossing the Ström channel,
we always went a long way up above the whirl, even
in the calmest weather, and then had to wait and
watch carefully for the slack&mdash;but now we were
driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a
hurricane as this!  'To be sure,' I thought, 'we
shall get there just about the slack&mdash;there is some
little hope in that'&mdash;but in the next moment I cursed
myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope
at all.  I knew very well that we were doomed, had
we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.
</p>

<p>
"By this time the first fury of the tempest had
spent itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much, as
we scudded before it, but at all events the seas,
which at first had been kept down by the wind, and
lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute
mountains.  A singular change, too, had come over
the heavens.  Around in every direction it was still
as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst
out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky&mdash;as clear
as I ever saw&mdash;and of a deep bright blue&mdash;and
through it there blazed forth the full moon with a
lustre that I never before knew her to wear.  She
lit up everything about us with the greatest
distinctness&mdash;but, O God, what a scene it was to light up!
</p>

<p>
"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my
brother&mdash;but in some manner which I could not
understand, the din had so increased that I could
not make him hear a single word, although I screamed
at the top of my voice in his ear.  Presently he
shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held
up one of his fingers, as if to say '<i>Listen!</i>'
</p>

<p>
"At first I could not make out what he meant&mdash;but
soon a hideous thought flashed upon me.  I
dragged my watch from its fob.  It was not going.
I glanced at its face by the moonlight, and then
burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean.
<i>It had run down at seven o'clock!  We were behind
the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Ström was in
full fury!</i>
</p>

<p>
"When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and
not deep laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she
is going large, seem always to slip from beneath
her&mdash;which appears very strange to a landsman&mdash;and
this is what is called <i>riding</i>, in sea phrase.
</p>

<p>
"Well, so far we had ridden the swells very
cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to
take us right under the counter, and bore us with it
as it rose&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;as if into the sky.  I would
not have believed that any wave could rise so high.
And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a
plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was
falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream.
But while we were up I had thrown a quick glance
around&mdash;and that one glance was all sufficient.  I
saw our exact position in an instant.  The Moskoe-ström
whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead
ahead&mdash;but no more like the everyday Moskoe-ström,
than the whirl as you now see it, is like a
mill-race.  If I had not known where we were, and
what we had to expect, I should not have recognized
the place at all.  As it was, I involuntarily closed
my eyes in horror.  The lids clenched themselves
together as if in a spasm.
</p>

<p>
"It could not have been more than two minutes
afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside,
and were enveloped in foam.  The boat made a
sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its
new direction like a thunderbolt.  At the same
moment the roaring noise of the water was
completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek&mdash;such a
sound as you might imagine given out by the water-pipes
of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off
their steam all together.  We were now in the belt
of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I
thought, of course, that another moment would
plunge us into the abyss&mdash;down which we could only
see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity
with which we were borne along.  The boat did not
seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an
air-bubble upon the surface of the surge.  Her
starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard
arose the world of ocean we had left.  It stood like
a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"It may appear strange, but now, when we were
in the very jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed
than when we were only approaching it.  Having
made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a
great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.
I supposed it was despair that strung my nerves.
</p>

<p>
"It may look like boasting&mdash;but what I tell you is
truth&mdash;I began to reflect how magnificent a thing it
was to die in such a manner, and how foolish it was in
me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own
individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation
of God's power.  I do believe that I blushed
with shame when this idea crossed my mind.  After
a little while I became possessed with the keenest
curiosity about the whirl itself.  I positively felt
a wish to explore its depths, even at the sacrifice I
was going to make; and my principal grief was that
I should never be able to tell my old companions on
shore about the mysteries I should see.  These, no
doubt, were singular fancies to occupy a man's mind
in such extremity&mdash;and I have often thought since,
that the revolutions of the boat around the pool
might have rendered me a little light-headed.
</p>

<p>
"There was another circumstance which tended to
restore my self-possession; and this was the
cessation of the wind, which could not reach us in our
present situation&mdash;for, as you saw yourself, the belt
of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of
the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a
high, black, mountainous ridge.  If you have never
been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of
the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and
spray together.  They blind, deafen, and strangle
you, and take away all power of action or reflection.
But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these
annoyances&mdash;just as death-condemned felons in
prison are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden them
while their doom is yet uncertain.
</p>

<p>
"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is
impossible to say.  We careered round and round
for perhaps an hour, flying rather than floating,
getting gradually more and more into the middle of
the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible
inner edge.  All this time I had never let go of the
ring-bolt.  My brother was at the stern, holding on
to a small empty water-cask, which had been securely
lashed upon the coop of the counter, and was
the only thing on deck that had not been swept
overboard when the gale first took us.  As we approached
the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and
made for the ring, from which, in the agony of his
terror, he endeavoured to force my hands, as it was
not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp.  I
never felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt
this act&mdash;although I knew he was a madman when
he did it&mdash;a raving maniac through sheer fright.  I
did not care, however, to contest the point with him.
I knew it could make no difference whether either of
us held on at all; so I let him have the bolt, and went
astern to the cask.  This there was no great difficulty
in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough,
and upon an even keel&mdash;only swaying to and fro,
with the immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.
Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position,
when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed
headlong into the abyss.  I muttered a hurried
prayer to God, and thought all was over.
</p>

<p>
"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had
instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and
closed my eyes.  For some seconds I dared not open
them&mdash;while I expected instant destruction, and
wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles
with the water.  But moment after moment
elapsed.  I still lived.  The sense of falling had
ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much
as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with
the exception that she now lay more along.  I took
courage and looked once again upon the scene.
</p>

<p>
"Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror,
and admiration with which I gazed about me.  The
boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway
down, upon the interior surface of a funnel, vast in
circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose
perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for
ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which
they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly
radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon,
from that circular rift amid the clouds which I have
already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory
along the black walls, and far away down into the
inmost recesses of the abyss.
</p>

<p>
"At first I was too much confused to observe
anything accurately.  The general burst of terrific
grandeur was all that I beheld.  When I recovered
myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively
downward.  In this direction I was able to obtain an
unobstructed view, from the manner in which the
smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool.  She
was quite upon an even keel&mdash;that is to say, her deck
lay in a plane parallel with that of the water&mdash;but
this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty-five
degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our
beam-ends.  I could not help observing, nevertheless,
that I had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining
my hold and footing in this situation, than if we had
been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was
owing to the speed at which we revolved.
</p>

<p>
"The rays of the moon seemed to search the very
bottom of the profound gulf; but still I could make
out nothing distinctly, on account of a thick mist in
which everything there was enveloped, and over
which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that
narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmans say
is the only pathway between Time and Eternity.
This mist, or spray, was no doubt occasioned by the
clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they all
met together at the bottom&mdash;but the yell that went
up to the heavens from out of that mist, I dare not
attempt to describe.
</p>

<p>
"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt
of foam above, had carried us to a great distance
down the slope; but our farther descent was by no
means proportionate.  Round and round we swept&mdash;not
with any uniform movement&mdash;but in dizzying
swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few
hundred yards&mdash;sometimes nearly the complete
circuit of the whirl.  Our progress downward, at each
revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.
</p>

<p>
"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid
ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that
our boat was not the only object in the embrace of
the whirl.  Both above and below us were visible
fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber
and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such
as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels
and staves.  I have already described the unnatural
curiosity which had taken the place of my original
terrors.  It appeared to grow upon me as I drew
nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.  I now
began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous
things that floated in our company.  I must have
been delirious&mdash;for I even sought amusement in
speculating upon the relative velocities of their
several descents toward the foam below.  'This fir tree,'
I found myself at one time saying, 'will certainly be
the next thing that takes the awful plunge and
disappears,' and then I was disappointed to find that
the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and
went down before.  At length, after making several
guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all&mdash;this
fact&mdash;the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set
me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs
again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.
</p>

<p>
"It was not a new terror that thus affected me,
but the dawn of a more exciting <i>hope</i>.  This hope
arose partly from memory and partly from present
observation.  I called to mind the great variety of
buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden,
having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the
Moskoe-ström.  By far the greater number of the
articles were shattered in the most extraordinary
way&mdash;so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance
of being stuck full of splinters&mdash;but then I
distinctly recollected that there were <i>some</i> of them
which were not disfigured at all.  Now I could not
account for this difference except by supposing that
the roughened fragments were the only ones which
had been <i>completely absorbed</i>&mdash;that the others had
entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or,
from some reason, had descended so slowly after
entering, that they did not reach the bottom before
the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb as the case
might be.  I conceived it possible, in either instance,
that they might thus be whirled up again to the level
of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those
which had been drawn in more early or absorbed
more rapidly.  I made, also, three important
observations.  The first was, that as a general rule, the
larger the bodies were, the more rapid their
descent&mdash;the second, that, between two masses of equal
extent, the one spherical, and the other of any other
shape, the superiority in speed of descent was with
the sphere&mdash;the third, that, between two masses of
equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any
other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more
slowly.  Since my escape, I have had several
conversations on this subject with an old schoolmaster of
the district; and it was from him that I learned the
use of the words 'cylinder' and 'sphere.'  He
explained to me&mdash;although I have forgotten the
explanation&mdash;how what I observed was, in fact, the
natural consequence of the forms of the floating
fragments&mdash;and showed me how it happened that a
cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more
resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater
difficulty than an equally bulky body of any form
whatever.*

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"There was one startling circumstance which
went a great way in enforcing these observations,
and rendering me anxious to turn them to account,
and this was that, at every revolution, we passed
something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast
of a vessel, while many of these things, which had
been on our level when I first opened my eyes upon
the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up
above us, and seemed to have moved but little from
their original station.
</p>

<p>
"I no longer hesitated what to do.  I resolved to
lash myself securely to the water cask upon which I
now held, to cut it loose from the counter, and to
throw myself with it into the water.  I attracted my
brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating
barrels that came near us, and did everything in my
power to make him understand what I was about
to do.  I thought at length that he comprehended
my design&mdash;but whether this was the case or not, he
shook his head despairingly, and refused to move
from his station by the ring-bolt.  It was impossible
to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay;
and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his
fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the
lashings which secured it to the counter, and
precipitated myself with it into the sea, without another
moment's hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"The result was precisely what I had hoped it
might be.  As it is myself who now tell you this
tale&mdash;as you see that I did escape&mdash;and as you are
already in possession of the mode in which this
escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate
all that I have further to say&mdash;I will bring my story
quickly to conclusion.  It might have been an
hour, or thereabout, after my quitting the smack,
when, having descended to a vast distance beneath
me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it,
plunged headlong, at once and for ever, into the
chaos of foam below.  The barrel to which I was
attached sunk very little farther than half the
distance between the bottom of the gulf and the
spot at which I leaped overboard, before a great
change took place in the character of the whirlpool.
The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became
momentarily less and less steep, the gyrations of the
whirl grew gradually less and less violent.  By
degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared,
and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to uprise.
The sky was clear, the winds had gone down, and the
full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I
found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view
of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where
the pool of the Moskoe-ström had been.  It was
the hour of the slack&mdash;but the sea still heaved in
mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.
I was borne violently into the channel of the Ström,
and in a few minutes, was hurried down the coast
into the 'grounds' of the fishermen.  A boat picked
me up&mdash;exhausted from fatigue&mdash;and (now that
the danger was removed)&mdash;speechless from the
memory of its horror.  Those who drew me on
board were my old mates and daily companions&mdash;but
they knew me no more than they would have
known a traveller from the spirit-land.  My hair,
which had been raven-black the day before, was as
white as you see it now.  They say, too, that the
whole expression of my countenance had changed.
I told them my story&mdash;they did not believe it.  I
now tell it to <i>you</i>&mdash;and I can scarcely expect you to
put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of
Lofoden."

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
